Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

 

We may share your information with third parties, including responsible companies with which we have a

relationship. For example:

offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for

 • We may be required to disclose customer information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or

court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, we may share account or other information

when we believe it is necessary to comply with law or to protect our interests or property. This may include

sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.

 • If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Thefacebook business were to change, your user information

would likely be transferred to the new owner.
