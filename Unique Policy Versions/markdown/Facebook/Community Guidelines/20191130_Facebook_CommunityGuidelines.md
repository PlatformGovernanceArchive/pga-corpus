**1. Violence and Incitement** 

**I. Violence and Criminal Behavior** 

Policy Rationale 

We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. 

While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by 

threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that 

incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and 

work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm 

or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in 

order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat 

to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also 

consider additional information like a person&aposs public visibility and the risks to their 

physical safety. 

In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and 

other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non 

credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. 

Do not post: 

Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any 

target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: 

Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or

**6. Suicide and Self-Injury** 

**II. Safety** 

Policy Rationale 

In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that 

encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time 

depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-

injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-

mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can 

share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from 

one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. 

We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in 

distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies 

and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not 

remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and 

authorities to provide help or resources. 

 

In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or 

survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. 

Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we 

provide. 

Do not post: 

 

Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for 

Suicide 

Self-injury 

Eating disorders 

Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery 

Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post 

content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide 

Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave 

stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated 

with eating disorders. 

 

Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared 

together with terms associated with eating disorders. 

 

For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and 

include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: 

 

Photos or videos depicting a person&aposs death by suicide that are determined to 

be newsworthy

the content may be upsetting to some: 

 

Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other 

non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery 

Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or 

protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context.

**8.****Sexual Exploitation of Adults**  

**II. Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

 

We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention 

to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation 

and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but 

remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, 

or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or 

coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-

consensual sexual acts. 

To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual 

violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. 

As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and 

improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may 

remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful 

activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate 

images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together 

a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent. 

Do not post:

crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including:

**9. Bullying and Harassment**  

**II. Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, 

from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending 

threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate 

this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on 

Facebook. 

We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to 

allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are 

featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we 

remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is 

directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes 

further: we remove content that&aposs meant to degrade or shame, including, for 

example, claims about someone&aposs sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and 

harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our 

policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. 

Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is 

clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying 

and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us 

understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting 

such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on 

Facebook to help protect against it. 

We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and 

educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers 

step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations 

about bullying.

Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: 

Unwanted or

**10. Human Exploitation** 

**II. Safety** 

Policy Rationale 

In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or 

coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define 

human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the 

exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or 

other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and 

degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or 

materially benefiting others. 

Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, 

socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and 

any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the 

coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. 

While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two 

can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as 

the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international 

borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation 

of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in 

pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on 

movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. 

Do not post: 

Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any 

of the following: 

Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults 

The sale of children for illegal adoption 

Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism

deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. 

Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, 

harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. 

Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it.

their own 

**12. Hate Speech** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of 

intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. 

We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected 

characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual 

orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We 

also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or 

dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. 

We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. 

Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the 

purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms 

that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an 

empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic 

break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in 

a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In 

all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their 

intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is 

unclear, we may remove the content. 

We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we 

believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary 

using their authentic identity.

hate speech.

**13. Violent and Graphic Content** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

 

We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of 

others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We 

allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about 

issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human 

rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different 

sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a 

warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to 

people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or 

violent nature before they click to see it. 

Do not post:

captions by the poster or comments under such imagery that contain 

 

Enjoyment of suffering

content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages 

eighteen and older: 

 

Imagery featuring mutilated people if it contains the following in a medical setting

**15. Sexual Solicitation** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

 

Policy Rationale 

As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), 

people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and 

exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. 

We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates 

sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that 

may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may 

be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to 

connect with their friends and the broader community. 

Do not post: 

Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not 

limited to: 

Filmed sexual activities 

Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances 

Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages 

Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or 

asking for: 

Sex or sexual partners 

Sex chat or conversations 

Nude photos, videos or imagery 

Content that meets both of the following criteria: 

Criteria 1: Offer or Ask 

Content implicitly or indirectly***** (typically through providing a method of 

contact) offers or asks for: 

Nude imagery, or 

Sex or sexual partners, or 

Sex chat conversations 

Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements 

Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the 

following sexually suggestive elements: 

Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji 

strings, or 

Regional sexualized slang, or 

Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, 

digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, 

fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or 

activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or 

Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, 

objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude 

butts 

Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or 

asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. 

For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not 

ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. 

An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links 

to external pornographic websites) 

Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: 

A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or 

An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising 

fetish scenarios) 

 

 

**16. Cruel and Insensitive** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or 

premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual 

touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury 

We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, 

many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. We also remove any form of 

sadism towards people or animals. 

Do not post: 

Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or 

premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, starvation, physical violence, 

domestic violence, or serious physical injury 

**17. Misrepresentation**

The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and 

Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. 

 

 

**18. Spam** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

 

Policy Rationale 

 

We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content 

that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. 

This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people&aposs ability to 

engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from 

abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or 

distribute content en masse for commercial gain. 

 

Do not: 

 

Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events 

or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. 

Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product 

features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, 

likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined 

by our Branded Content Policy. 

 

Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, 

sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. 

Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under 

false pretenses, such as: 

 

Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a 

‘Dislike’ button!”) 

 

Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount 

code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) 

 

Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading 

use of URLs, defined as: 

 

**Cloaking**: Presenting different content to Facebook users and 

Facebook crawlers or tools. 

 

**Misleading content:** Content contains a link that promises one 

type of content but delivers something substantially different. 

Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action 

(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected 

landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes 

after the required action is complete. 

**Like / Share-Gating**: Landing pages that require users to like, 

share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access 

to off-Facebook content. 

 

**Deceptive Landing Page Functionality**: Websites that have a 

misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic 

being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) 

 

**Impersonation**: The website pretends to be a reputable brand 

or service by usin 

g a name, domain, or content featuring 

typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known 

brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face\_book.com, using a 

landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). 

 

And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed 

above. 

 

**19. Cybersecurity** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy Rationale 

We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal 

information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or 

invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we 

want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user 

information through the abuse of our platform and products. 

Do not: 

Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through 

unauthorized means, defined as: 

Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without 

explicit permission from the account owner. 

Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or 

programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and 

programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain 

unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. 

Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or 

through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to 

capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). 

Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, 

passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the 

use of malicious software or websites. 

Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a 

third party service. 

Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser 

extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. 

Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain 

Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that 

a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or 

Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. 

 

 

**20. Inauthentic Behavior** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy Rationale 

In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don&apost allow people to misrepresent 

themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of 

content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our 

Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can 

trust the people and communities they interact with. 

Do not: 

 

Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people 

 

Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others 

 

Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control 

of that Page 

 

Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the 

use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to 

mislead people or Facebook: 

about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent 

about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets 

about the purpose of an audience or community 

about the source or origin of content 

to evade enforcement under our Community Standards 

 

Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined 

as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to 

engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake 

accounts is central to the operation 

 

Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is 

Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or 

government actor. 

 

 

**21. False news** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy rationale 

 

Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take 

seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want 

to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is 

also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we 

don&apost remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its 

distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to 

reduce the spread of false news here. 

 

We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false 

news in a number of different ways, namely by 

 

Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that 

propagate misinformation 

Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a 

machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false 

Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party 

fact-checkers 

Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by 

informing them with more context and promoting news literacy 

Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this 

challenging issue 

 

 

**22. Memorialization** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy Rationale

When someone passes away, friends and family can request that we memorialize 

the account by adding "Remembering" above the name on the person&aposs profile. This 

makes it clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against 

attempted logins and fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change 

anything about the profile or the account because we want to respect the choices 

someone made while alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify 

a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. People can let us 

know in advance if they want their account permanently deleted when they die. We 

may delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would 

have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it. 

 

Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and 

process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we&aposre building to support people 

during these difficult times.

**23. Intellectual property** 

 

**V. Respecting Intellectual Property** 

 

Policy rationale 

 

Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are 

important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You 

own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control
