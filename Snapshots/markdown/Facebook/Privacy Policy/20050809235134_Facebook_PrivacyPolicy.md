Thefacebook Privacy Policy

**[ Privacy Policy ]**

This policy is effective as of June 28, 2005.

Introduction

 

Thefacebook Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and

use the personal information that you provide to us and to assist you in making informed

decisions when using Thefacebook web site located at www.thefacebook.com (the "Web

Site").

 

The Information We Collect

 

When you visit the Web Site you may provide us with two types of information: personal

information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and Web Site use

information collected by us on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web Site.

When you register on the Web Site, you provide us with certain personal information, such

as your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address, your gender,

schools attended and any other personal or preference information that you provide to us.

When you enter our Web Site, we collect the user's browser type and IP address. This

information is gathered for all users to the Web Site. In addition, we store certain

information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the

user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm

that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the users close the browser. We do

not use cookies to collect private information from any user.

Thefacebook also collects information about you from other sources, such as newspapers

and instant messaging services. This information is gathered regardless of your use of the

Web Site. 

 

Use of Information Obtained by Thefacebook

 

When you register on the Web Site, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your

profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the

groups specified in your privacy settings to support the function of the Web Site. In

addition, we may use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding the

Web Site and, occasionally, new services we think you may find valuable. 

No personal information that you submit to Thefacebook will be available to any user of the

Web Site who does not belong to at least one of the groups specified by you in your

privacy settings. 

We use the information about you that we have collected from other sources to

supplement your profile unless you specify in your privacy settings that you do not want

this to be done.

 

Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

 

We may share your information with third parties, including responsible companies with

which we have a relationship. For example:

 • We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we

offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to send

email solicitations. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our

service providers may have access to your personal information for use in connection

with these business activities.

 • We may be required to disclose customer information pursuant to lawful requests,

such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws.

Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is

necessary to comply with law or to protect our interests or property. This may include

sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.

 • If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Thefacebook business were to

change, your user information would likely be transferred to the new owner.

If you do not want to receive promotional email from Thefacebook and/or do not want us

to share your information with third parties for marketing purposes, please submit a

request by emailing us at info@thefacebook.com. We will make every effort to implement

any choice you make as soon as possible. 

 

Links

 

This site may contain links to other websites. Thefacebook is not responsible for the privacy

practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our

site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally

identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by

Thefacebook Web Site.

 

Third Party Advertising

 

Advertisements that appear on the Web Site are delivered to users by our advertising

partners. Our advertising partners may download cookies to your computer. Doing this

allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an

advertisement. In this way, they may compile information about where you, or others who

are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements

are clicked. This information allows an advertising network to deliver targeted

advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Thefacebook does not

have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Thefacebook and does not cover the

use of cookies by any of its advertisers.

 

Changing or Removing Information

 

Thefacebook users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time by

logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately.

 

Security

 

Thefacebook takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account

information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. Because email is not

recognized as a secure medium of communication, we request that you do not send private

information to us by email. If you have any questions about the security of Thefacebook

Web Site, please contact us.

 

Changes in Our Privacy Policy

 

We reserve the right to change our privacy policy at any time. If we do this, we will post

the changes to this policy on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's

effective date. We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so

that you understand our current privacy policy.
