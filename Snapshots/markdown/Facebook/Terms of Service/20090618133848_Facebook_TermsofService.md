**Statement of Rights and Responsibilities**

This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement") derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our

relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this

Statement.

**1. Privacy**

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures to you about how

we collect and use the information you post on Facebook. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use

the information it contains to help make informed decisions.

**2. Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how we share your content

through your privacy and application settings. In order for us to use certain types of content and provide you with

Facebook, you agree to the following:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you

specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a

non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you

post on or in connection with Facebook ("IP License"). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or

your account (except to the extent your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it).

2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.

However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time

(but will not be available to others).

3. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we

may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer

them).

**3. Safety**

We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help in order to do that, which

includes the following commitments:

1. You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications to users (such as spam).

2. You will not collect users' information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as

harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.

3. You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.

4. You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.

5. You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.

6. You will not post content that is hateful, threatening, pornographic, or that contains nudity or graphic or

gratuitous violence.

7. You will not develop or operate a third party application containing, or advertise or otherwise market alcohol-

related or other mature content without appropriate age-based restrictions.

8. You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.

9. You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement.

**4. Registration and Account Security**

Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some

commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:

1. You will not provide any false personal information on Facebook, or create an account for anyone other than

yourself without permission.

2. You will not use Facebook if you are under 13.

3. You will not use Facebook if you are located in a country embargoed by the U.S., or are on the U.S.

Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals.

4. You will not use Facebook if you are a convicted sex offender.

5. You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.

6. You will not share your password, let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might

jeopardize the security of your account.

7. You will not transfer your account to anyone without first getting our written permission.
