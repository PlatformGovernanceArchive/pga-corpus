not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person,

this Agreement, Instagram reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice. Deleted content may be

stored by Instagram in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently,

Instagram encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service.

Instagram will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Instagram Services, or the loss of any

Content.
