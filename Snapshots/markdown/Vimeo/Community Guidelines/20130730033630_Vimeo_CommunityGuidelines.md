**A few words about our community**

Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments

from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive

community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your

own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.

**Uploading Guidelines**

**1. I will upload only videos I created myself.**

You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.

“I have permission” does not mean you created it.

Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which

they have contributed significantly.

Public domain videos are not allowed.

Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.

**2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.**

Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or **Vimeo Plus** accounts to host their videos. Businesses

may, however, use a **Vimeo PRO** account to host their videos so long as they comply with the

**Vimeo PRO guidelines**.

Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians,

nonprofits, and actors who want to promote the work they have created.

You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video

unless given prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with

advertisements in them will be removed.

You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes,

cash gifting, work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.

You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate walkthroughs.

Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.

We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for businesses who

have coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other partnerships with Vimeo.

**3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.**

You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is allowed.

You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory speech; or

depict unlawful acts or extreme violence.

You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and the video

depicts only your involvement in the program.

You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs or movies.

You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima videos with

a story are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid accidental

deletion.

Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they cite their

involvement in the video description (maps and mods to commercial games are not allowed). No

commercial video game trailers are permitted.

**Speech Guidelines**

The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to insult

and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while you are on

Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and

provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,

don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner, you will be

banished forever.

**Go forth and connect**

Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so you can rack up

views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people, and so we strongly encourage you

to find people who share your interests and connect with them. The more you interact with others,

the more others will be interested in your work. So go ahead – get involved!
