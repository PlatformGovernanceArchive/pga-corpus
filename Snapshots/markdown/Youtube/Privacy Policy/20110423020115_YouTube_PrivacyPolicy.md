YouTube Privacy Notice

**Updated as of 8 December 2010**

The Google Privacy Policy describes how Google and its subsidiaries treat personal information when you use Google services,

including information provided when you use YouTube. In addition, the following describes privacy practices specific to YouTube.

**Personal Information**

**Browsing YouTube** You can watch videos on YouTube without having a YouTube Account or a Google Account. You can also

contact us through the YouTube Help Centre or by emailing us directly, without having to register for an account.

**Your YouTube Account.** For some activities on YouTube, such as uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos or watching

restricted videos, you need a YouTube or Google Account. We ask for some personal information when you create an account,

including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorised access. A Google Account,

additionally, allows you to access other Google services that require registration.

**Usage Information.** When you use YouTube, we may record information about your usage of the site, such as the channels, groups

and favourites to which you subscribe, which other users you communicate with, the videos that you watch, the frequency and size of

data transfers and information that you display about yourself, as well as information that you click in YouTube (including UI elements,

settings). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your YouTube Account. In order to ensure the quality of our

service to you, we may place a tag (also called a "web beacon") in HTML-based customer support emails or other communications

with you in order to confirm delivery.

**Content Uploaded to Site.** Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (e.g. video comments, your

profile page) may be collected and used by others. If you download the YouTube Uploader, your copy includes a unique application

number. This number and information about your installation of the Uploader (version number, language) will be sent to YouTube when

the Uploader automatically checks for updates and will be used to update your version of the Uploader.

**Uses**

If you submit personal information to YouTube, we may use that information to operate, maintain and improve the features and

functionality of YouTube, and to process any flagging activity or other communication that you send to us.

We do not use your email address or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent.

We may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major

YouTube changes or for customer service purposes). You can also choose how often YouTube sends you email updates in your

YouTube Account settings page.

We use cookies, web beacons and log-file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or

the next time that you visit YouTube; (b) provide custom, personalised content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our

marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries,

submissions and status in promotions, sweepstakes and contests.

**Information That is Publicly Available**

When you create a YouTube Account, some information about your YouTube Account and your account activity will be provided to

other users of YouTube. This may include the date that you opened your YouTube Account, the date that you last logged in to your

YouTube Account, your age (if you choose to make it public), the country and the number of videos that you have watched.

Your YouTube Account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when you engage in certain activities on YouTube,

such as when you upload videos or send messages through YouTube. Other users can contact you by leaving a message or comment

on the site.

Any videos that you submit to YouTube may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels and may be viewed by

other YouTube users or the general public.

You may also choose to add personal information which may include your name, gender, profile picture or other details, that will be

visible to other users on your YouTube Account channel page. If you choose to add certain features to your YouTube Account channel

page, then these features and your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other users and may be aggregated and

shared with your friends or other users. Such shared activity may include your favourite videos, videos that you rated and videos that

you have uploaded.

**Your Choices**

If you have a YouTube Account, you may update or correct your personal profile information, email preferences and privacy settings at

any time by visiting your account profile page.

You may control the information that is available to other users and your confirmed friends at any time by editing your YouTube

Account and the features that are included on your channel page. If you have enabled Active Sharing, other users may see that you,

as identified by your account name, not your email address, are watching the same video.

You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through YouTube, in which case you can still view videos and explore

YouTube, but YouTube may not be able to provide certain services to you. Some advanced YouTube features may use other Google

services such as Google Checkout or AdSense. The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your personal information

associated with them.

**Advertising on YouTube**

YouTube strives to provide you with relevant and useful advertising and we use the DoubleClick cookie as well as other third-party, ad-

serving systems to do so. We may use a range of information, including cookies, web beacons, IP addresses, usage data and other

non-personal information about your computer or device (such as browser type and operating system) to provide you with relevant

advertising. While you are logged in or logged out of your YouTube Account, we may also show you advertising based on non-

personally identifiable information that you have provided to us in your YouTube Account.

We use the DoubleClick cookie on YouTube to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads on this site and other Google

and AdSense partner websites. Advertisers may serve ads based on interests and demographic categories associated with non-

personally identifiable online activity, such as videos viewed, frequency of uploading or activity on other AdSense partner sites.

Advertisers may also serve ads to you based on previous activity on that advertiser's website or based on non-personally identifiable

information from other companies. This non-personally identifiable information is held separately from your YouTube Account data or

You may view, edit and add to the categories used to provide you with interest-based advertising in the Ad Preferences Manager for

the DoubleClick cookie. Your ad preferences will be respected across YouTube, AdSense partner sites and Google sites using the

DoubleClick cookie to serve such ads. For more information about interest-based advertising and the Ad Preferences Manager, see

our FAQ. To learn about the privacy policies of third parties which advertisers may use to display ads on YouTube and to opt out, you

can take a look at the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.

You may also choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time. If you select the DoubleClick opt-out cookie, ads delivered to

your browser by our ad-serving technology will not be served based on the DoubleClick cookie. Find more information here about

opting out of the DoubleClick cookie.

Other third-party ad-serving companies may display ads on YouTube, provided that they comply with our ad-serving requirements.

YouTube does not provide any personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. You should

consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for

instructions on how to opt out of certain practices. YouTube's privacy policy does not apply to and we cannot control the activities of

such other advertisers or websites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with YouTube are maintained and

dealt with by YouTube in accordance with this privacy policy.
