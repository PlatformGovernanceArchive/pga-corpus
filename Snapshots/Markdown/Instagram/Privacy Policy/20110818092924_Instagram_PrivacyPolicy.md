Burbn Inc. ("Burbn") operates several websites including instagr.am, instagram.com,

and burbn.com. It is Burbn’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information

we may collect while operating our websites.

Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Burbn collects non-personally-identifying information of

the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser

type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

Burbn’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better

understand how Burbn’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Burbn may

release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a

report on trends in the usage of its website.

Burbn also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol

(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Instagram posts.

Burbn only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same

circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as

described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed

to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Burbn’s websites choose to interact with Burbn in ways that require

Burbn to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information

that Burbn gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask

visitors who sign up for an account on http://instagram.com to provide a username and

email address. In each case, Burbn collects such information only insofar as is

necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Burbn.

Burbn does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described

below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with

the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Aggregated Statistics

Burbn may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Burbn may

display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Burbn does not

disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Burbn discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information

only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to

know that information in order to process it on Burbn’s behalf or to provide services

available at Burbn’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located

outside of your home country; by using Burbn’s websites, you consent to the transfer

of such information to them. Burbn will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying

and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,

contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Burbn discloses

potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when

required to do so by law, or when Burbn believes in good faith that disclosure is

reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Burbn, third parties or the

public at large. If you are a registered user of a Burbn website and have supplied your

email address, Burbn may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new

features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with

Burbn and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate

this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you

send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback

mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to

your request or to help us support other users. Burbn takes all measures reasonably

necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of

potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
