**Privacy at YouTube**

**Privacy**

**Updated as of December 8, 2010**

The Google Privacy Policy describes how Google and its subsidiaries treat personal information when you use Google

services, including information provided when you use YouTube. In addition, the following describes privacy practices specific

to YouTube.

Personal Information

**Browsing YouTube** You can watch videos on YouTube without having a YouTube Account or a Google Account. You also

can contact us through the YouTube Help Center or by emailing us directly without having to register for an account.

**Your YouTube Account.** For some activities on YouTube, like uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos, or

watching restricted videos, you need a YouTube or Google Account. We ask for some personal information when you create

an account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A

Google Account, additionally, allows you to access other Google services that require registration.

**Usage Information.** When you use YouTube, we may record information about your usage of the site, such as the channels,

groups and favorites you subscribe to, which other users you communicate with, the videos you watch, the frequency and size

of data transfers, and information you display about yourself as well as information you click on in YouTube (including UI

elements, settings). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your YouTube Account. In order to ensure the

quality of our service to you, we may place a tag (also called a "web beacon") in HTML-based customer support emails or

other communications with you in order to confirm delivery.

**Content Uploaded to Site.** Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (e.g., video

comments, your profile page) may be collected and used by others. If you download the YouTube Uploader, your copy

includes a unique application number. This number, and information about your installation of the Uploader (version number,

language) will be sent to YouTube when the Uploader automatically checks for updates and will be used to update your version

of the Uploader.

Uses

If you submit personal information to YouTube, we may use that information to operate, maintain, and improve the features and

functionality of YouTube, and to process any flagging activity or other communication you send to us.

We do not use your email address or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without your

consent. We may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as

notifying you of major YouTube changes or for customer service purposes). You also can choose how often YouTube sends

you email updates in your YouTube Account settings page.

We use cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during

your visit or the next time you visit YouTube; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the

effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed;

and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

Information That is Publicly Available

When you create a YouTube Account, some information about your YouTube Account and your account activity will be

provided to other users of YouTube. This may include the date you opened your YouTube Account, the date you last logged

into your YouTube Account, your age (if you choose to make it public), the country and the number of videos you have

watched.

Your YouTube Account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when you engage in certain activities on

YouTube, such as when you upload videos or send messages through YouTube. Other users can contact you by leaving a

message or comment on the site.

Any videos that you submit to YouTube may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be

viewed by other YouTube users or the general public.

You may also choose to add personal information which may include your name, gender, profile picture or other details, that

will be visible to other users on your YouTube Account channel page. If you choose to add certain features to your YouTube

Account channel page, then these features and your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other users

and may be aggregated and shared with your friends or other users. Such shared activity may include your favorite videos,

videos you rated and videos that you have uploaded.

Your Choices

If you have a YouTube Account, you may update or correct your personal profile information, email preferences and privacy

settings at any time by visiting your account profile page.

You may control the information that is available to other users and your confirmed friends at any time by editing your YouTube

Account and the features that are included on your channel page. If you have enabled Active Sharing, other users may see

that you, as identified by your account name, not your email address, are watching the same video.

You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through YouTube, in which case you can still view videos and

explore YouTube, but YouTube may not be able to provide certain services to you. Some advanced YouTube features may use

other Google services like Google Checkout or AdSense. The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your personal

information associated with them.

Advertising on YouTube

YouTube strives to provide you with relevant and useful advertising and we use the DoubleClick cookie, as well as other third

party ad serving systems, to do so. We may use a range of information including cookies, web beacons, IP addresses, usage

advertising based on non-personally identifiable information you have provided to us in your YouTube Account.

We use the DoubleClick cookie on YouTube to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads on this site and other

Google and AdSense partner websites. Advertisers may serve ads based on interests and demographic categories associated

with non-personally identifiable online activity, such as videos viewed, frequency of uploading or activity on other AdSense

partner sites. Advertisers may also serve ads to you based on previous activity on that advertiser's website or based on non-

personally identifiable information from other companies. This non-personally identifiable information is held separately from

your YouTube Account data, or other personally identifying information in our possession.

You may view, edit and add to the categories used to provide you with interest-based advertising in the Ads Preferences

Manager for the DoubleClick cookie. Your ads preferences will be respected across YouTube, AdSense partner sites and

Google sites using the DoubleClick cookie to serve such ads. For more information about interest-based advertising and the

Ads Preference Manager see our FAQ. To learn about the privacy policies of third parties that advertisers may use to display

ads on YouTube, and to opt out, you can check out the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.

You also may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time. If you select the DoubleClick opt-out cookie, ads

delivered to your browser by our ad-serving technology will not be served based on the DoubleClick cookie. Find more

information here about opting out of the DoubleClick cookie.

Other third-party ad serving companies may display ads on YouTube, provided they comply with our ad serving requirements.

YouTube does not provide any personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. You

should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their

practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. YouTube's privacy policy does not apply to, and we

cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently

shared with YouTube is maintained and dealt with by YouTube in accordance with this privacy policy.
