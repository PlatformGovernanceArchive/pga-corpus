Community Guidelines

1. Your relationship with YouTube

1.1 Your use of the YouTube website (the "Website") and any YouTube products, channels, software, data feeds and

services, including the YouTube embeddable video player (the "YouTube Player") provided to you on or from or through the

Website by YouTube (collectively the "Service") is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and YouTube.

"YouTube" means YouTube LLC, whose principal place of business is at 901 Cherry Avenue, San Bruno, CA 94066, United

States.

1.2 Your legal agreement with YouTube is made up of (A) the terms and conditions set out in this document, (B) YouTube's

Privacy Policy (https://www.youtube.co.zw/t/privacy) and (C) YouTube's Community Guidelines

(https://www.youtube.co.zw/t/community\_guidelines) (collectively called the "Terms").

1.3 The Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and YouTube in relation to your use of the Service. It is

important that you take the time to read them carefully.

1.4 The Terms apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content, on the Service.

"Content" includes the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive

features and other materials you may view on, access through or contribute to the Service.

2. Accepting the Terms

2.1 In order to use the Service, you must firstly agree to the Terms. You may not use the Service if you do not accept the

Terms.

2.2 You can accept the Terms by simply using the Service. You understand and agree that YouTube will treat your use of the

Service as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

2.3 You may not use the Service and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with

YouTube, or (b) you are a person who is either barred or otherwise legally prohibited from receiving or using the Service under

the laws of the country in which you are resident or from which you access or use the Service.

2.4 You should print off or save a local copy of the Terms for your records.

3. Changes to the Terms

YouTube reserves the right to make changes the Terms from time to time, for example to address changes to the law or

regulatory changes or changes to functionality offered through the Service. Therefore you must look at the Terms regularly to

check for such changes. The modified version of the Terms (the "Modified Terms") will be posted at

https://www.youtube.co.zw/t/terms or made available within the Service (for any modified additional terms). If you do not

agree to the Modified Terms you must stop using the Service. Your continued use of the Service after the date the Modified

Terms are posted will constitute your acceptance of the Modified Terms.

4. YouTube accounts

4.1 In order to access some features of the Website or other elements of the Service, you will have to create a YouTube

account. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. It is important that you must

keep your YouTube account password secure and confidential.

4.2 You must notify YouTube immediately of any breach of security or unauthorised use of your YouTube account that you

become aware of.

4.3 You agree that you will be solely responsible (to YouTube, and to others) for all activity that occurs under your YouTube

account.

5. General restrictions on use

5.1 YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service, subject to the following express conditions, and

you agree that your failure to adhere to any of these conditions shall constitute a breach of these Terms on your part:

A. you agree not to distribute any part of or parts of the Website or the Service, including but not limited to any Content,

in any medium without YouTube's prior written authorisation, unless YouTube makes available the means for such

distribution through functionality offered by the Service (such as the YouTube Player);

B. you agree not to alter or modify any part of the Website or any of the Service (including but not limited to the YouTube

Player and its related technologies);

C. you agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Website

itself, the YouTube Player, or such other means as YouTube may explicitly designate for this purpose;

D. you agree not to (or attempt to) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with any security related features of the

Service or features that (i) prevent or restrict use or copying of Content or (ii) enforce limitations on use of the Service or

the content accessible via the Service;

E. you agree not to use the Service (including the YouTube Player) for any of the following commercial uses unless you

obtain YouTube's prior written approval:

Terms of Service

ii. the sale of advertising, sponsorships or promotions placed on or within the Service, or Content;

iii. the sale of advertising, sponsorships or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content

delivered via the Service unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of

sufficient value to be the basis for such sales

F. prohibited commercial uses shall not include (i) uploading an original video to YouTube, (ii) maintaining an original

channel on the Website in order to promote a business or artistic enterprise, (iii) showing YouTube videos through the

YouTube Player or otherwise on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to those advertising restrictions set out in

5.1(E)(iii) above; and (iv) any use that is expressly authorised by YouTube in writing;

G. if you use the YouTube Player on your website may not modify, build upon or block any portion or functionality of the

YouTube Player including but not limited to links back to the Website;

H. you agree not to use or launch any automated system (including, without limitation, any robot, spider or offline reader)

that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of

time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a publicly available, standard (i.e. not

modified) web browser;

I. you agree not to collect or harvest any personal data of any user of the Website or any Service (and agree that this

shall be deemed to include YouTube account names);

J. you agree not to use the Website or the Services (including the comments and email features in the Website) for the

solicitation of business in the course of trade or in connection with a commercial enterprise;

K. you agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Website with respect to their Content; and

L. you agree not to access Content or any reason other than your personal, non-commercial use solely as intended

through and permitted by the normal functionality of the Service, and solely for Streaming. "Streaming" means a

contemporaneous digital transmission of the material by YouTube via the Internet to a user operated Internet enabled

device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be downloaded (either

permanently or temporarily), copied, stored, or redistributed by the user.

for any other purposes without the prior written consent of YouTube or the respective licensors of the Content.

5.2 You agree that you will comply with all of the other provisions of the Terms and the YouTube Community Guidelines at all

times during your use of the Service.

5.3 YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the

sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.

YouTube reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.

5.4 YouTube is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and

agree that the form and nature of the Service which YouTube provides may change from time to time without prior notice to

you.

5.5 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that YouTube may stop (permanently or temporarily)

providing the Service (or any features within the Service) to you or to users generally at YouTube's sole discretion, without

prior notice to you. You may stop using the Service at any time. You do not need to specifically inform YouTube when you

stop using the Service.

5.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that YouTube has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any

breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which YouTube may

suffer) of any such breach.

YouTube the licence referred to in paragraph 8.1 below.

7.8 On becoming aware of any potential violation of these Terms, YouTube reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to

decide whether Content complies with the content requirements set out in these Terms and may remove such Content and/or

terminate a User's access for uploading Content which is in violation of these Terms at any time, without prior notice and at

its sole discretion.

7.9 You further understand and acknowledge that in using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is factually

equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against YouTube with respect to any such Content.

8. Rights you licence

8.1 When you upload or post Content to YouTube, you grant:

A. to YouTube, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable licence (with right to sub-licence) to use, reproduce,

distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform that Content in connection with the provision of the Service

permitted by the functionality of the Service and under these Terms.

8.2 The above licenses granted by you in Content terminate when you remove or delete your Content from the Website. The

without prejudice to your ownerships rights, which are retained by you as set out in paragraph 7.2 above.

9.1 With the exception of Content submitted to the Service by you, all other Content on the Service is either owned by or

licensed to YouTube, and is subject to copyright, trade mark rights, and other intellectual property rights of YouTube or

YouTube's licensors. Any third party trade or service marks present on Content not uploaded or posted by you are trade or

service marks of their respective owners. Such Content may not be downloaded, copied, reproduced, distributed, transmitted,

broadcast, displayed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any other purpose whatsoever without the prior written

consent of YouTube or, where applicable, YouTube's licensors. YouTube and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly

benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed

to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.6 shall continue to apply to

such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

12. Exclusion of Warranties

12.1 Nothing in the Terms shall affect any statutory rights that you are always entitled to as a consumer and that you cannot

contractually agree to alter or waive.

12.2 The Service is provided "as is" and YouTube makes no warranty or representation to you with respect to them.

12.3 In particular YouTube does not represent or warrant to you that:

A. your use of the Service will meet your requirements,

B. your use of the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or free from error,

C. any information obtained by you as a result of your use of the Service will be accurate or reliable, and

D. that defects in the operation or functionality of any software provided to you as part of the Service will be corrected.

12.4 No conditions, warranties or other terms (including any implied terms as to satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose or

B. any loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of:

i. any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, or as a result of any

relationship or transaction between you and any advertiser or sponsor whose advertising appears on the Service;

the Service (or any features within the Service);

iii. the deletion of, corruption of, or failure to store, any Content and other communications data maintained or transmitted

14. General legal terms

14.1 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and YouTube and govern your use of the Service and

completely replace any prior agreements between you and YouTube in relation to the Service. All other terms of service that

Google Inc. and any of its subsidiaries may have in place from time to time are expressly excluded from the Terms.

14.2 You agree that YouTube may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email,

regular mail, or postings on the Service.

14.3 You agree that if YouTube does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or

which YouTube has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of YouTube's rights

and that those rights or remedies will still be available to YouTube.

14.4 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then

that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms

will continue to be valid and enforceable.

14.5 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which YouTube is a part shall be third party

beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of

the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favour of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be a third

party beneficiary of the Terms.

14.6 The Terms, and your relationship with YouTube under the Terms, shall be governed by English law. You and YouTube

agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.

Notwithstanding this, you agree that YouTube shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or other equivalent types

of urgent legal remedy) in any jurisdiction.
