Violent threats policy

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the glorification of violence.** 

Healthy conversation is only possible when people feel safe from abuse and don’t resort to using violent language. For this 

reason, we have a policy against threatening violence on Twitter. We define violent threats as statements of an intent to kill 

or inflict serious physical harm on a specific person or group of people. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy, you can’t state an intention to inflict violence on a specific person or group of people. We define intent to 

include statements like “I will”, “I’m going to”, or “I plan to”, as well as conditional statements like “If you do X, I will”. 

Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to: 

● 

threatening to kill someone; 

● 

threatening to sexually assault someone; 

● 

threatening to seriously hurt someone and/or commit a other violent act that could lead to someone’s death or 

serious physical injury; and 

● 

asking for or offering a financial reward in exchange for inflicting violence on a specific person or group of people. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

We recognize that some people use violent language as part of hyperbolic speech or between friends, so we also allow 

some forms of violent speech where it’s clear that there is no abusive or violent intent, e.g., “I’ll kill you for sending me that 

plot spoiler!”. 

This policy is enforced in tandem with our policies on abusive behavior and hateful conduct. Statements that express a wish 

or hope that someone experiences physical harm, making vague or indirect threats, or threatening actions that are unlikely 

to cause serious or lasting injury are not actionable under this policy, but may be reviewed and actioned under those 

policies. **Note:** we also have a policy against encouraging self-harm and suicide. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have a Twitter account or not.

**Glorification of violence policy**

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the glorification of violence.** 

Glorifying violent acts could inspire others to take part in similar acts of violence. Additionally, glorifying violent events 

where people were targeted on the basis of their protected characteristics (including: race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual 

orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease) could incite or lead to further 

violence motivated by hatred and intolerance. For these reasons, we have a policy against content that glorifies acts of 

violence in a way that may inspire others to replicate those violent acts and cause real offline harm, or events where 

members of a protected group were the primary targets or victims. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy, you can’t glorify, celebrate, praise or condone violent crimes, violent events where people were targeted 

because of their membership in a protected group, or the perpetrators of such acts. We define glorification to include 

praising, celebrating, or condoning statements, such as “I’m glad this happened”, “This person is my hero”, “I wish more 

people did things like this”, or “I hope this inspires others to act”. 

Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to, glorifying, praising, condoning, or celebrating: 

● 

violent acts committed by civilians that resulted in death or serious physical injury, e.g., murders, mass shootings; 

● 

attacks carried out by terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups (as defined by our terrorism and violent 

extremism policy); and 

● 

violent events that targeted protected groups, e.g., the Holocaust, Rwandan genocide. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

Our focus is on preventing the glorification of violence that could inspire others to replicate violent acts, as well as violent 

events where protected groups were the primary targets or victims. Exceptions may be made for violent acts by state 

actors, where violence was not primarily targeting protected groups. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have a Twitter account or not. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?**

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

The consequences for violating our glorification of violence policy depends on the severity of the violation and the 

account’s previous history of violations. 

The first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of 

your account before you can Tweet again. If you continue to violate this policy after receiving a warning, your account will 

be permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal.

Benesch: *Countering Dangerous Speech: New Ideas for Genocide Prevention* and the Dangerous Speech Project. 

 

 

Terrorism and violent extremism policy  

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not threaten or promote terrorism or violent extremism.**  

There is no place on Twitter for terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups and individuals who affiliate with and 

promote their illicit activities. The violence that these groups engage in and/or promote jeopardizes the physical safety and 

well-being of those targeted. Our assessments in this context are informed by national and international terrorism 

designations. We also assess organizations under our violent extremist group criteria. 

Violent extremist groups are those that meet all of the below criteria: 

● 

identify through their stated purpose, publications, or actions as an extremist group; 

● 

have engaged in, or currently engage in, violence and/or the promotion of violence as a means to further their 

cause; and 

● 

target civilians in their acts and/or promotion of violence. 

We examine a group’s activities both on and off Twitter to determine whether they engage in and/or promote violence 

against civilians to advance a political, religious and/or social cause. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy, you can’t affiliate with and promote the illicit activities of a terrorist organization or violent extremist 

group. Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to: 

● 

engaging in or promoting acts on behalf of a terrorist organization or violent extremist group; 

● 

recruiting for a terrorist organization or violent extremist group; 

● 

providing or distributing services (e.g., financial, media/propaganda) to further a terrorist organization’s or violent 

extremist group’s stated goals; and 

● 

using the insignia or symbols of terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups to promote them. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

We may make limited exceptions for groups that have reformed or are currently engaging in a peaceful resolution process, 

as well as groups with representatives who have been elected to public office through democratic elections. We may also 

make exceptions related to the discussion of terrorism or extremism for clearly educational or documentary purposes. This 

policy also doesn’t apply to military or government entities. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have a Twitter account or not.

**Child sexual exploitation policy**

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**We have a zero-tolerance child sexual exploitation policy on Twitter.** 

Twitter has **zero tolerance towards any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation**, one of the most 

serious violations of the Twitter Rules. This may include media, text, illustrated, or computer-generated images. Regardless 

of the intent, viewing, sharing, or linking to child sexual exploitation material contributes to the re-victimization of the 

depicted children. This also applies to content that may further contribute to victimization of children through the 

promotion or glorification of child sexual exploitation. For the purposes of this policy, a minor is any person under the age 

of 18. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Any content that depicts or promotes child sexual exploitation including, but not limited to: 

● 

visual depictions of a child engaging in sexually explicit or sexually suggestive acts; 

● 

illustrated, computer-generated or other forms of realistic depictions of a human child in a sexually explicit 

context, or engaging in sexually explicit acts; 

● 

sexualized commentaries about or directed at a known or unknown minor; and 

● 

links to third-party sites that host child sexual exploitation material. 

The following behaviors are also not permitted: 

● 

sharing fantasies about or promoting engagement in child sexual exploitation; 

● 

expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation; 

● 

recruiting, advertising or expressing an interest in a commercial sex act involving a child, or in harboring and/or 

transporting a child for sexual purposes; 

● 

sending sexually explicit media to a child; 

● 

engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation; 

● 

trying to obtain sexually explicit media from a child or trying to engage a child in sexual activity through blackmail 

or other incentives; and 

● 

identifying alleged victims of childhood sexual exploitation by name or image. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

Discussions related to child sexual exploitation as a phenomenon or attraction towards minors are permitted, provided they 

don’t promote or glorify child sexual exploitation **in any way**. Artistic depictions of nude minors in a non-sexualized context 

or setting may be permitted in a limited number of scenarios e.g., works by internationally renowned artists that feature 

minors. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have a Twitter account or not. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?** 

If you think you&aposve found a Twitter account distributing or promoting child sexual exploitation, you can report it via our 

child sexual exploitation form. Provide the username and links to all relevant Tweets that led you to believe the account 

should be reviewed. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

In the majority of cases, the consequence for violating our child sexual exploitation policy is **immediate and permanent** 

**suspension**. In addition, violators will be prohibited from creating any new accounts in the future. Note: when we’re made 

aware of content depicting or promoting child sexual exploitation, including links to third party sites where this content can 

be accessed, they will be removed without further notice and reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited 

Children (NCMEC). 

In a limited number of situations, where we haven’t identified any malicious intent, we will require you to remove this 

content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. Further violations will lead to 

your account being permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an 

appeal. 

**Additional resources** 

Learn more about our range of enforcement options and our approach to policy development and enforcement. 

If you’ve found content elsewhere on the internet that is distributing or promoting child sexual exploitation, you should file 

a report with NCMEC, or with your local law enforcement. If you believe the content is hosted on a website outside of the 

United States, you can report it on the International Association of Internet Hotlines website. 

We partner with multiple organisations whose work is dedicated to fighting child sexual exploitation around the world. 

Please see the full list of our child protection partners. 

**What you can do**  

If you think you&aposve found a Twitter account distributing or promoting child sexual 

exploitation, please report it through our designated form. Please provide the username 

and links to the relevant tweets that lead you to believe the account should be 

investigated. For help on how to find the direct status links to individual Tweets, see our 

help page.  

If you have found content elsewhere on the internet that is distributing or promoting 

child sexual exploitation, you should file a report with NCMEC here or with your local 

law enforcement. If you believe the content is hosted on a website outside of the United 

States, you can report it on the International Association of Internet Hotlines website.

**Abusive behavior**

Twitter Rules: You may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so. We consider 

abusive behavior an attempt to harass, intimidate, or silence someone else’s voice. 

**Rationale** 

On Twitter, you should feel safe expressing your unique point of view. We believe in freedom of expression and open 

dialogue, but that means little as an underlying philosophy if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up. 

In order to facilitate healthy dialogue on the platform, and empower individuals to express diverse opinions and beliefs, we 

prohibit behavior that harasses or intimidates, or is otherwise intended to shame or degrade others. In addition to posing 

risks to people’s safety, abusive behavior may also lead to physical and emotional hardship for those affected. 

Learn more about our approach to policy development and our enforcement philosophy. 

**When this applies** 

Some Tweets may seem to be abusive when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a larger 

conversation. When we review this type of content, it may not be clear whether it is intended to harass an individual, or if it 

is part of a consensual conversation. To help our teams understand the context of a conversation, we may need to hear 

directly from the person being targeted, to ensure that we have the information needed prior to taking any enforcement 

action. 

We will review and take action against reports of accounts targeting an individual or group of people with any of the 

following behavior within Tweets or Direct Messages. For accounts engaging in abusive behavior on their profile, please 

refer to our abusive profile policy. For behavior targeting people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual 

orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease, this may be in violation of 

our hateful conduct policy. 

**Wishing or hoping serious harm on a person or group of people** 

We do not tolerate content that wishes, hopes or expresses a desire for death, serious bodily harm or fatal disease against 

an individual or group of people. This includes, but is not limited to: 

● 

Hoping that someone dies as a result of a serious disease e.g., “I hope you get cancer and die.” 

● 

Wishing for someone to fall victim to a serious accident e.g., “I wish that you would get run over by a car next 

time you run your mouth.” 

● 

Saying that a group of individuals deserves serious physical injury e.g., “If this group of protesters don’t shut up, 

they deserve to be shot.” 

**Unwanted sexual advances** 

While some consensual nudity and adult content is permitted on Twitter, we prohibit unwanted sexual advances and 

content that sexually objectifies an individual without their consent. This includes, but is not limited to: 

● 

sending someone unsolicited and/or unwanted adult media, including images, videos, and GIFs; 

● 

unwanted sexual discussion of someone’s body; 

● 

solicitation of sexual acts; and 

● 

any other content that otherwise sexualizes an individual without their consent. 

**Using aggressive insults with the purpose of harassing or intimidating others** 

We take action against excessively aggressive insults that target an individual, including content that contains slurs or 

similar language. Please also note that while some individuals may find certain terms to be offensive, we will not action 

against every instance where insulting terms are used. 

**Encouraging or calling for others to harass an individual or group of people** 

We prohibit behavior that encourages others to harass or target specific individuals or groups with abusive behavior. This 

includes, but is not limited to; calls to target people with abuse or harassment online and behavior that urges offline action 

such as physical harassment. 

**Do I need to be the target of this content for it to be reviewed for violating the Twitter Rules?** 

No, we review both first-person and bystander reports of such content. 

**Consequences** 

When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, the 

severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. 

For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before 

they can Tweet again. Subsequent violations will lead to longer read-only periods and may eventually result in permanent 

suspension. If an account is engaging primarily in abusive behavior, we may permanently suspend the account upon initial 

review. 

Learn more about our range of enforcement options. 

 

**Hateful conduct policy**

**Hateful conduct:** You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, 

ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. 

We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories. 

**Hateful imagery and display names:** You may not use hateful images or symbols in your profile image or profile header. 

You also may not use your username, display name, or profile bio to engage in abusive behavior, such as targeted 

harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group, or protected category. 

**Rationale** 

Twitter’s mission is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, and to express their opinions 

and beliefs without barriers. Free expression is a human right – we believe that everyone has a voice, and the right to use it. 

Our role is to serve the public conversation, which requires representation of a diverse range of perspectives. 

We recognise that if people experience abuse on Twitter, it can jeopardize their ability to express themselves. Research has 

shown that some groups of people are disproportionately targeted with abuse online. This includes; women, people of 

color, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual individuals, marginalized and historically 

underrepresented communities. For those who identity with multiple underrepresented groups, abuse may be more 

common, more severe in nature and have a higher impact on those targeted. 

We are committed to combating abuse motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, particularly abuse that seeks to 

silence the voices of those who have been historically marginalized. For this reason, we prohibit behavior that targets 

individuals with abuse based on protected category. 

If you see something on Twitter that you believe violates our hateful conduct policy, please report it to us. 

**When this applies** 

We will review and take action against reports of accounts targeting an individual or group of people with any of the 

following behavior, whether within Tweets or Direct Messages. 

**Violent threats** 

We prohibit content that makes violent threats against an identifiable target. Violent threats are declarative statements of 

intent to inflict injuries that would result in serious and lasting bodily harm, where an individual could die or be significantly 

injured, e.g., “I will kill you”. 

**Note:** we have a zero tolerance policy against violent threats. Those deemed to be sharing violent threats will face 

immediate and permanent suspension of their account. 

**Wishing, hoping or calling for serious harm on a person or group of people** 

We prohibit content that wishes, hopes, promotes, or expresses a desire for death, serious and lasting bodily harm, or 

serious disease against an entire protected category and/or individuals who may be members of that category. This 

includes, but is not limited to: 

● 

Hoping that someone dies as a result of a serious disease, e.g., “I hope you get cancer and die.” 

● 

Wishing for someone to fall victim to a serious accident, e.g., “I wish that you would get run over by a car next 

time you run your mouth.” 

● 

Saying that a group of individuals deserve serious physical injury, e.g., “If this group of protesters don’t shut up, 

they deserve to be shot.” 

**References to mass murder, violent events, or specific means of violence where protected groups have been the primary** 

**targets or victims** 

We prohibit targeting individuals with content that references forms of violence or violent events where a protected 

category was the primary target or victims, where the intent is to harass. This includes, but is not limited to sending 

someone: 

● 

media that depicts victims of the Holocaust; 

● 

media that depicts lynchings. 

**Inciting fear about a protected category** 

We prohibit targeting individuals with content intended to incite fear or spread fearful stereotypes about a protected 

category, including asserting that members of a protected category are more likely to take part in dangerous or illegal 

activities, e.g., “all [religious group] are terrorists”. 

**Repeated and/or non-consensual slurs, epithets, racist and sexist tropes, or other content that degrades someone** 

We prohibit targeting individuals with repeated slurs, tropes or other content that intends to dehumanize, degrade or 

reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected category. This includes targeted misgendering or deadnaming 

of transgender individuals. 

**Hateful imagery** 

We consider hateful imagery to be logos, symbols, or images whose purpose is to promote hostility and malice against 

others based on their race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or ethnicity/national origin. Some 

examples of hateful imagery include, but are not limited to: 

● 

symbols historically associated with hate groups, e.g., the Nazi swastika; 

● 

images depicting others as less than human, or altered to include hateful symbols, e.g., altering images of 

individuals to include animalistic features; or 

● 

images altered to include hateful symbols or references to a mass murder that targeted a protected category, 

e.g., manipulating images of individuals to include yellow Star of David badges, in reference to the Holocaust. 

Media depicting hateful imagery is not permitted within live video, account bio, profile or header images. All other 

instances must be marked as sensitive media. Additionally, sending an individual unsolicited hateful imagery is a violation of 

our abusive behavior policy. 

**Do I need to be the target of this content for it to be a violation of the Twitter** 

**Rules?** 

Some Tweets may appear to be hateful when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a larger 

conversation. For example, members of a protected category may refer to each other using terms that are typically 

considered as slurs. When used consensually, the intent behind these terms is not abusive, but a means to reclaim terms 

that were historically used to demean individuals. 

When we review this type of content, it may not be clear whether the intention is to abuse an individual on the basis of 

their protected status, or if it is part of a consensual conversation. To help our teams understand the context, we 

sometimes need to hear directly from the person being targeted to ensure that we have the information needed prior to 

taking any enforcement action. 

**Note:** individuals do not need to be member of a specific protected category for us to take action. We will never ask people 

to prove or disprove membership in any protected category and we will not investigate this information. 

**Consequences** 

Under this policy, we take action against behavior that targets individuals or an entire protected category with hateful 

conduct, as described above. Targeting can happen in a number of ways, for example, mentions, including a photo of an 

individual, referring to someone by their full name, etc. 

When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to the 

severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. For example, we may ask someone to remove 

the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can Tweet again. Subsequent violations will 

lead to longer read-only periods and may eventually result in permanent account suspension. If an account is engaging 

primarily in abusive behavior, or is deemed to have shared a violent threat, we will permanently suspend the account upon 

initial review. 

Learn more about our range of enforcement options. 

If someone believes their account was suspended in error, they can submit an appeal. 

 

**Glorifying self-harm and suicide**

Twitter Rules: You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm. When we receive 

reports that a person is threatening suicide or self-harm, we may take a number of steps to 

assist them, such as reaching out to that person and providing resources such as contact 

information for our mental health partners. 

**Rationale** 

While we want people to feel safe sharing their thoughts and feelings, we draw the line at 

encouraging or promoting self-harm and suicidal behavior, which can pose safety risks for 

others. With that in mind, we apply a two-pronged approach to the issue: supporting people 

who are undergoing experiences with self-harm or suicidal thoughts, but prohibiting the 

promotion or encouragement of self-harming behaviors. 

Learn more about how you can help someone dealing with thoughts of self-harm or suicide. 

**When this applies** 

Some examples of encouraging or promoting self-harm include (but may not be limited to) 

encouraging or glorifying: 

● Acts of injuring oneself, such as cutting 

● Eating disorders such as bulimia, anorexia, and serious illnesses that cause severe 

disturbances to a person&aposs eating behaviors. 

● The act of taking one’s own life, including sharing strategies for suicide and 

participating in group suicides or suicide games 

Some examples of behavior that are not considered glorifying or encouraging: 

● Discussions or organizations focused on research, advocacy, and education of self-

harm or suicide prevention 

● Sharing coping mechanisms and resources for thoughts of self-harm and suicide 

**Consequences** 

Our approach towards suicide and self-harm depends on the type of content, whether or not 

the account is encouraging or promoting self-harm, and the account’s previous record of 

violations. 

The first time someone violates this policy, they will be required to remove the violating 

Tweet and be temporarily locked out of their account before they can Tweet again. 

People who repeatedly violate this policy and/or accounts dedicated to promoting or 

encouraging self-harm and suicide may be suspended. If someone believes their account 

was suspended in error, they can submit an appeal. 

After we assess a report of self-harm or suicide, Twitter will contact the reported individual 

and let them know that someone who cares about them identified that they might be at risk. 

We will provide the reported individual with available resources and encourage them to 

seek help. 

In some cases where content is not glorifying or encouraging suicide or self-harm, we may 

still interstitial Tweets as sensitive. Learn more about our sensitive media policy.

**Sensitive media policy**

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not post media that is excessively gory or share violent or adult content within live video or in profile or header** 

**images. Media depicting sexual violence and/or assault is also not permitted.** 

People use Twitter to show what’s happening in the world, often sharing images and videos as part of the conversation. 

Sometimes, this media can depict sensitive topics, including violent and adult content. We recognize that some people may 

not want to be exposed to sensitive content, which is why we balance allowing people to share this type of media with 

helping people who want to avoid it to do so. 

For this reason, you can’t include violent, hateful, or adult content within areas that are highly visible on Twitter, including 

in live video, profile or header images. If you share this content within Tweets, you need to mark your account as sensitive. 

Doing so places images and videos behind an interstitial (or warning message), that needs to be acknowledged before your 

media can be viewed. Using this feature means that people who don’t want to see sensitive media can avoid it, or make an 

informed decision before they choose to view it. 

Under this policy, there are also some types of sensitive media content that we don’t allow at all, because they have the 

potential to normalize violence and cause distress to those who view them. 

We group sensitive media content into the following categories: 

**Graphic violence** 

Graphic violence is any media that depicts death, violence, medical procedures, or serious physical injury in graphic detail. 

Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of: 

● 

violent crimes or accidents; 

● 

physical fights; 

● 

physical child abuse; 

● 

bodily fluids including blood, feces, semen etc.; 

● 

serious physical harm, including visible wounds; and 

● 

severely injured or mutilated animals. 

**Note:** exceptions may be made for documentary or educational content. 

**Adult content** 

Adult content is any consensually produced and distributed media that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal. 

Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of: 

● 

full or partial nudity, including close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or breasts (excluding content related to 

breastfeeding); 

● 

simulated sexual acts; and 

● 

sexual intercourse or other sexual acts – this also applies to cartoons, hentai, or anime involving humans or 

depictions of animals with human-like features. 

**Note:** exceptions may be made for artistic, medical, health, or educational content. 

For content that was created or distributed without the consent of those featured, please refer to our non-consensual 

nudity policy. 

**Violent sexual conduct** 

Violent sexual conduct is any media that depicts violence, whether real or simulated, in association with sexual acts. Some 

examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of: 

● 

rape and other forms of violent sexual assault, or sexual acts that occur without the consent of participants, 

including a simulated lack of consent; and 

● 

sexualized violence – inflicting physical harm on an individual within an intimate setting, where it is not 

immediately obvious if those involved have consented to take part. 

**Gratuitous gore** 

Gratuitous gore is any media that depicts excessively graphic or gruesome content related to death, violence or severe 

physical harm, or violent content that is shared for sadistic purposes. Some examples include, but are not limited to, 

depictions of: 

● 

dismembered or mutilated humans; 

● 

charred or burned human remains; 

● 

exposed internal organs or bones; and 

● 

animal torture or killing. **Note:** exceptions may be made for religious sacrifice, food preparation or processing, 

and hunting. 

**Hateful imagery** 

Hateful imagery is any logo, symbol, or image that has the intention to promote hostility against people on the basis of 

race, religious affiliation, disability, sexual orientation, gender/gender identity or ethnicity/national origin. Some examples 

of hateful imagery include, but are not limited to: 

● 

symbols historically associated with hate groups, e.g., the Nazi swastika; 

● 

images depicting others as less than human, or altered to include hateful symbols, e.g., altering images of 

individuals to include animalistic features; or 

● 

images altered to include hateful symbols or references to a mass murder that targeted a protected category, 

e.g., manipulating images of individuals to include yellow Star of David badges, in reference to the Holocaust. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Our aim is to limit exposure to sensitive images and videos and to prevent the sharing of potentially disturbing types of 

sensitive media. For this reason, we differentiate our enforcement approach depending on the type of media that has been 

shared and where it has been shared. 

**Graphic violence, adult content, and hateful imagery** 

● 

you can’t target people with unsolicited images or videos that contain graphic violence, adult content, or hateful 

imagery; and 

● 

you can’t include graphic violence, adult content, or hateful imagery within live video, profile, or header images. 

**Violent sexual conduct and gratuitous gore** 

We prohibit violent sexual conduct to prevent the normalization of sexual assault and non-consensual violence associated 

with sexual acts. We prohibit gratuitous gore content because research has shown that repeated exposure to violent 

content online may negatively impact an individual’s wellbeing. For these reasons, you can’t share images or videos that 

depict violent sexual conduct or gratuitous gore on Twitter. **Note:** very limited exceptions may be made for gory media 

associated with newsworthy events. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

You can share graphic violence and consensually produced adult content within your Tweets, provided that you mark this 

media as sensitive. We may also allow limited sharing of hateful imagery, provided that it is not used to promote a terrorist 

or violent extremist group, that you mark this content as sensitive and don’t target it at an individual (via mentioning 

someone or including an identifiable individual within such images). 

To mark your media as sensitive, navigate to your safety settings and select the **Mark media you Tweet as containing** 

**material that may be sensitive** option. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we will do so manually if your content is 

reported for review. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy via our dedicated reporting flows. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?** 

**In-app** 

You can report this content for review in-app as follows:

**Desktop** 

You can report this content for review via desktop as follows: 

1. 

Select **Report Tweet** from the icon. 

2.

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

The enforcement action we take depends on the type of media you have shared, and where you have shared it. 

**Graphic violence, adult content, and hateful imagery** 

● 

live video and profile images – the first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this content. 

We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you violate this policy again 

after your first warning, your account will be permanently suspended; 

● 

sending someone unsolicited violent or adult content – if you target someone with sensitive media in a clearly 

abusive or unsolicited way, we’ll require you to remove it under our abusive behavior policy; and 

● 

accounts dedicated to posting sensitive media – your account may be permanently suspended if the majority of 

your activity on Twitter is sharing sensitive media. 

If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal. 

**Violent sexual conduct and gratuitous gore** 

● 

if you share media that depicts violent sexual conduct or gratuitous gore anywhere on Twitter, we will require 

you to remove this content. 

● 

if your account is dedicated to posting this type of content, your account will be immediately permanently 

suspended. 

If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal.

**April 2019** 

**You may not use our service for any unlawful purpose or in furtherance of illegal activities. This includes selling, buying,** 

**or facilitating transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or services.**  

Twitter takes the safety of our users seriously. In an effort to address the potential for real-world harm, we do not allow the 

use of Twitter for any unlawful behavior or to further illegal activities. This includes selling, buying, or facilitating 

transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or services. In some cases, we may ask 

you to contact a law enforcement agency and have them contact us via our law enforcement request page to ensure we 

have enough context to enforce this policy. In addition to reports received, we proactively surface activity that may violate 

this policy for human review. 

Goods or services covered under this policy include, but are not limited to: 

● 

counterfeit goods and services*; 

● 

drugs and controlled substances; 

● 

human trafficking; 

● 

products made from endangered or protected species;

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

The consequences for violating this policy depends on the severity of the violation and the account’s previous history of 

violations. 

If you violate this policy more than once and/or if your account is dedicated to the sale of illegal or regulated goods and/or 

services, your account may be suspended permanently. 

Accounts that appear to be using misleading account information in order to engage in spamming, abusive, or disruptive 

behavior to promote the sale of illegal and regulated goods and/or services may be subject to suspension under 

our platform manipulation and spam policy. 

If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal.

**Private information policy**

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not publish or post other people&aposs private information without their express authorization and permission. We** 

**also prohibit threatening to expose private information or incentivizing others to do so.** 

Sharing someone’s private information online without their permission, sometimes called doxxing, is a breach of their 

privacy and of the Twitter Rules. Sharing private information can pose serious safety and security risks for those affected 

and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship. 

When reviewing reports under this policy, we consider a number of things, including: 

**What type of information is being shared?** 

We consider this because certain types of private information carry higher risks than others, if they’re shared without 

permission. Our primary aim is to protect individuals from coming to physical harm as a result of their information being 

shared, so we consider information like physical location to be a higher risk than other types of information. 

**Who is sharing the information?** 

We also consider who is sharing the reported information and whether or not they have the consent of the person it 

belongs to. We do this because we know that there are times when people may want some forms of their personal 

information to be shared publicly. For example, sharing a personal phone number or email for professional networking or 

to coordinate social events or publicly sharing someone’s home addresses to seek help after a natural disaster. 

**Is the information available elsewhere online?** 

If the reported information was shared somewhere else before it was shared on Twitter, e.g., someone sharing their 

personal phone number on their own publicly accessible website, we may not treat this information as private, as the 

owner has made it publicly available. Note: we may take action against home addresses being shared, even if they are 

publicly available, due to the potential for physical harm. 

**Why is the information being shared?** 

We also factor in the intent of the person sharing the information. For example, if we believe that someone is sharing 

information with an abusive intent, or to harass or encourage others to harass another person, we will take action. On the 

other hand, if someone is sharing information in an effort to help someone involved in a crisis situation like in the 

aftermath of a violent event, we may not take action. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy, you can’t share the following types of private information, without the permission of the person who it 

belongs to: 

● 

home address or physical location information, including street addresses, GPS coordinates or other identifying 

information related to locations that are considered private; 

● 

identity documents, including government-issued IDs and social security or other national identity numbers – 

note: we may make limited exceptions in regions where this information is not considered to be private; 

● 

contact information, including non-public personal phone numbers or email addresses; 

● 

financial account information, including bank account and credit card details; and 

● 

other private information, including biometric data or medical records. 

The following behaviors are also not permitted: 

● 

threatening to publicly expose someone’s private information; 

● 

sharing information that would enable individuals to hack or gain access to someone’s private information 

without their consent,e.g., sharing sign-in credentials for online banking services; 

● 

asking for or offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for posting someone’s private information; 

● 

asking for a bounty or financial reward in exchange for not posting someone’s private information, sometimes 

referred to as blackmail. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

The following are not in violation of this policy: 

● 

people sharing their own private information; 

● 

sharing information that is publicly available elsewhere, in a non-abusive manner; and 

● 

sharing information that we don’t consider to be private, including: 

o 

name; 

o 

birthdate or age; 

o 

place of education or employment; 

o 

location information related to commercial property or places of business, where this information is 

publicly available; 

o 

descriptions of physical appearance; 

o 

gossip, rumours, accusations, and allegations; and 

o 

screenshots of text messages or messages from other platforms (unless they contain private 

information e.g., phone number). 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report private information that has been shared in a clearly abusive way (whether they have a Twitter account 

or not). In cases where the information hasn’t been shared with a clearly abusive intent, we need to hear directly from the 

owner of this information (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) before taking enforcement action.

**Non-consensual nudity policy**

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their** 

**consent.** 

Sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their consent is a severe violation of their privacy and 

the Twitter Rules. Sometimes referred to as revenge porn, this content poses serious safety and security risks for people 

affected and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship. 

**What is a violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy, you can’t post or share explicit images or videos that were taken, appear to have been taken or that were 

shared without the consent of the people involved. 

Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to: 

● 

hidden camera content featuring nudity, partial nudity, and/or sexual acts; 

● 

creepshots or upskirts - images or videos taken of people’s buttocks, up an individual’s skirt/dress or other 

clothes that allows people to see the person’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts; 

● 

images or videos that superimpose or otherwise digitally manipulate an individual’s face onto another person’s 

nude body; 

● 

images or videos that are taken in an intimate setting and not intended for public distribution; and 

● 

offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for intimate images or videos. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

Pornography and other forms of consensually produced adult content are allowed on Twitter, provided that this media is 

marked as sensitive. Doing so provides people who may not want to see this type of content with a warning that they will 

need to acknowledge before viewing your media. 

To mark your media as sensitive, navigate to your safety settings and select the **Mark media you Tweet as containing** 

**material that may be sensitive** option. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we may do so manually if your content is 

reported for review. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Because Twitter allows some types of adult content, we need to evaluate context to assess if reported content has been 

created or shared without the consent of those involved. 

**Content reportable by anyone** 

We recognize that it can be difficult for those impacted to report this type of content for review. To reduce the burden on 

those affected, anyone can report the following types of content: 

● 

creepshots or upskirts; 

● 

content where a bounty or financial reward is offered in exchange for non-consensual nudity media; and 

● 

intimate images or videos that are accompanied by: 

● 

text that wishes/hopes for harm to come to those depicted or otherwise refers to revenge e.g., “I hope you get 

what you deserve when people see this”; and 

● 

information that could be used to contact those depicted e.g., “You can tell my ex what you think by calling them 

on 1234567”. 

**Content reportable by featured individual(s)** 

For other types of content, we may need to hear directly from the individual(s) featured (or an authorized representative, 

such as a lawyer) to ensure that we have sufficient context before taking any enforcement action. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?** 

**In-app** 

You can report this content for review in-app as follows: 

1. 

Select **Report Tweet** from the icon. 

2. 

Select **It’s abusive or harmful**.

**video** option. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

We will **immediately and permanently suspend any account that we identify as the original poster of intimate media** that 

was created or shared without consent. We will do the same with any account that posts only this type of content, e.g., 

accounts dedicated to sharing upskirt images. 

In other cases, we may not suspend an account immediately. This is because some people share this content inadvertently, 

to express shock, disbelief or to denounce this practice. In these cases, we will require you to remove this content. We will 

also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you violate this policy again after your first 

warning, your account will be permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you 

can submit an appeal.

**Platform manipulation and spam policy**

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not use Twitter’s services in a manner** **intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in** 

**behavior that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience on Twitter.** 

We want Twitter to be a place where people can make human connections, find reliable information, and express 

themselves freely and safely. To make that possible, we do not allow spam or other types of platform manipulation. We 

define platform manipulation as using Twitter to engage in bulk, aggressive, or deceptive activity that misleads others 

and/or disrupts their experience. 

Platform manipulation can take many forms and our rules are intended to address a wide range of prohibited behavior, 

including: 

● 

commercially-motivated spam, that typically aims to drive traffic or attention from a conversation on Twitter to 

accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives; 

● 

inauthentic engagements, that attempt to make accounts or content appear more popular or active than they 

are; and 

● 

coordinated activity, that attempts to artificially influence conversations through the use of multiple accounts, 

fake accounts, automation and/or scripting. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy we prohibit a range of behaviors in the following areas: 

**Accounts and identity** 

**You can’t mislead others on Twitter by operating** **fake accounts.** This includes using misleading account information to 

engage in spamming, abusive, or disruptive behavior. Some of the factors that we take into consideration include: 

● 

use of stock or stolen profile photos, particularly those depicting other people; 

● 

use of stolen or copied profile bios; and 

● 

use of intentionally misleading profile information, including profile location. 

**You can’t artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts.** This includes: 

● 

overlapping accounts – operating multiple accounts with overlapping use cases, such as identical or similar 

personas or substantially similar content; 

● 

mutually interacting accounts – operating multiple accounts that interact with one another in order to inflate or 

manipulate the prominence of specific Tweets or accounts; and 

● 

coordination – creating multiple accounts to post duplicative content or create fake engagement, including: 

o 

posting identical or substantially similar Tweets or hashtags from multiple accounts you operate; 

o 

engaging (Retweets, Likes, mentions, Twitter Poll votes) repeatedly with the same Tweets or accounts 

from multiple accounts that you operate; and 

o 

coordinating with or compensating others to engage in artificial engagement or amplification, even if 

the people involved use only one account. 

**Engagement and metrics** 

**You can’t artificially inflate your own or others’ followers or engagement.** This includes: 

● 

selling/purchasing Tweet or account metric inflation – selling or purchasing followers or engagements (Retweets, 

Likes, mentions, Twitter Poll votes); 

● 

apps – using or promoting third-party services or apps that claim to add followers or add engagements to Tweets; 

● 

reciprocal inflation – trading or coordinating to exchange follows or Tweet engagements (including but not 

limited to participation in “follow trains,” “decks,” and “Retweet for Retweet” behavior); and 

● 

account transfers or sales – selling, purchasing, trading, or offering the sale, purchase, or trade of Twitter 

accounts, usernames, or temporary access to Twitter accounts. 

**Misuse of Twitter product features** 

**You can’t misuse Twitter product features to disrupt others’ experience.** This includes: 

**Tweets and Direct Messages** 

● 

sending bulk, aggressive, high-volume unsolicited replies, mentions, or Direct Messages; 

● 

posting and deleting the same content repeatedly; 

● 

repeatedly posting identical or nearly identical Tweets, or repeatedly sending identical Direct Messages; and 

● 

repeatedly posting Tweets or sending Direct Messages consisting of links shared without commentary, so that this 

comprises the bulk of your Tweet/Direct Message activity. 

**Following** 

● 

“follow churn” – following and then unfollowing large numbers of accounts in an effort to inflate one’s own 

follower count; 

● 

indiscriminate following – following and/or unfollowing a large number of unrelated accounts in a short time 

period, particularly by automated means; and 

● 

duplicating another account’s followers, particularly using automation. 

**Engagement** 

● 

aggressively or automatically engaging with Tweets to drive traffic or attention to accounts, websites, products, 

services, or initiatives. 

● 

aggressively adding users to Lists or Moments. 

**Hashtags** 

● 

using a trending or popular hashtag with an intent to subvert or manipulate a conversation or to drive traffic or 

attention to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives; and 

● 

Tweeting with excessive, unrelated hashtags in a single Tweet or across multiple Tweets. 

**URLs** 

● 

publishing or linking to malicious content intended to damage or disrupt another person’s browser (malware) or 

computer or to compromise a person’s privacy (phishing); and 

● 

posting misleading or deceptive links; e.g., affiliate links and clickjacking links. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

The following are not in violation of this policy: 

● 

using Twitter pseudonymously or as a parody, commentary, or fan account; 

● 

posting links without commentary occasionally; and 

● 

operating multiple accounts with distinct identities, purposes, or use cases. These accounts may interact with one 

another, provided they don’t violate other rules. Some examples include: 

o 

organizations with related but separate chapters or branches, such as a business with multiple 

locations; 

o 

operating a personal account in addition to pseudonymous accounts or accounts associated with your 

hobbies or initiatives; and 

o 

hobby/artistic bots.

appeal if we’ve falsely identified your URL as unsafe. 

**Tweet deletion and temporary account locks** 

● 

If the platform manipulation or spam offense is an isolated incident or first offense, we may take a number of 

actions ranging from requiring deletion of one of more Tweets to temporarily locking account(s). Any subsequent 

platform manipulation offenses will result in permanent suspension. 

● 

In the case of a violation centering around the use of multiple accounts, you may be asked to choose one account 

to keep. The remaining accounts will be permanently suspended. 

● 

If we believe you may be in violation of our fake accounts policy, we may require you provide government-issued 

identification (such as a driver’s license or passport) in order to reinstate your account. 

**Permanent suspension** 

For severe violations, accounts will be permanently suspended at first detection. Examples of severe violations include: 

● 

operating accounts where the majority of behavior is in violation of the policies described above; 

● 

using any of the tactics described on this page to undermine the integrity of elections; 

● 

buying/selling accounts; 

● 

creating accounts to replace or mimic a suspended account; and 

● 

operating accounts that Twitter is able to reliably attribute to entities known to violate the Twitter Rules. 

If you believe that your account was locked or suspended in error, you can submit an appeal.

**Election integrity policy** 

**Overview** 

**April 2019** 

**You may not use Twitter’s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in** **elections. This includes posting or** 

**sharing content that may suppress voter turnout or mislead people about when, where, or how to vote.** 

The public conversation occurring on Twitter is never more important than during elections. Any attempts to undermine 

the integrity of our service is antithetical to our fundamental rights and undermines the core tenets of freedom of 

expression, the value upon which our company is based. 

We believe we have a responsibility to protect the integrity of those conversations from interference and manipulation. 

Therefore, we prohibit attempts to use our services to manipulate or disrupt elections, including through the distribution of 

false or misleading information about the electoral process or when or how to vote. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

We prohibit 3 categories of manipulative behavior and content under this policy: 

**Misleading information about how to participate** 

You can’t share false or misleading information about how to participate in an election or other civic event. This includes 

but is not limited to: 

● 

misleading information about how to vote or register to vote (for example, that you can vote by Tweet, text 

message, email, or phone call); 

● 

misleading information about requirements for voting, including identification requirements; and 

● 

misleading statements or information about the official, announced date or time of an election. 

**Voter suppression and intimidation** 

You can’t share false or misleading information intended to intimidate or dissuade voters from participating in an election. 

This includes but is not limited to: 

● 

misleading claims that polling places are closed, that polling has ended, or other misleading information relating 

to votes not being counted; 

● 

misleading claims about police or law enforcement activity related to polling places or elections; 

● 

misleading claims about long lines or equipment problems at voting locations; 

● 

misleading claims about voting procedures or techniques which could dissuade voters from participating in an 

election; and 

● 

threats regarding voting locations (note that our violent threats policy may also be relevant for threats not 

covered by this policy). 

**False or misleading affiliation** 

You can’t create fake accounts which misrepresent their affiliation, or share content that falsely represents its affiliation, to 

a candidate, elected official, political party, electoral authority, or government entity. Read more about our parody, 

commentary, and fan account policy. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

Not all false or untrue information about politics or political events constitutes manipulation or interference in an election. 

In the absence of other violations, the following are generally not in violation of this policy: 

● 

inaccurate statements about an elected official, candidate, or political party; 

● 

organic content that is polarizing, biased, hyperpartisan, or contains controversial viewpoints expressed about 

elections or politics; 

● 

discussion of public polling information; and 

● 

using Twitter pseudonymously or as a parody, commentary, or fan account to discuss elections or politics. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Accurate reporting of suspected violations of this policy requires information and knowledge specific to an election. 

Therefore, we enable reporting of false or misleading information about voting or registering to vote for people accessing 

Twitter in advance of major elections. We also work with select government and civil society partners in these countries to 

provide additional options for reporting and expedited review. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?** 

If the reporting option for this policy is enabled in your country, you can report this content in-app or on desktop. 

**In-app** 

You can report this content for review in-app as follows: 

1. 

Select **Report Tweet** from the icon. 

2. 

Select **It’s misleading about voting**. 

3. 

Select the option that best tells us how the Tweet is misleading about voting. 

4. 

Submit your report. 

**Desktop** 

You can report this content for review on desktop as follows: 

1.

3. 

Select the option that best tells us how the Tweet is misleading about voting. 

4. 

Submit your report. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

The consequences for violating our election integrity policy depends on the severity and type of the violation and the 

accounts’ history of previous violations. The actions we take may include the following: 

**Tweet deletion** 

The first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of 

your account before you can Tweet again. 

**Profile modifications** 

If you violate this policy within your profile information (e.g., your bio), we will require you to remove this content. We will 

also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you violate this policy again after your first 

warning, your account will be permanently suspended. 

**Permanent suspension** 

For severe or repeated violations of this policy, accounts will be permanently suspended. 

If you believe that your account was locked or suspended in error, you can submit an appeal.

Impersonation policy  

Impersonation is a violation of the Twitter Rules. Twitter accounts that pose as another 

person, brand, or organization in a confusing or deceptive manner may be permanently 

suspended under Twitter’s impersonation policy.  

What is not an impersonation policy violation?  

Accounts with similar usernames or that are similar in appearance (e.g., the same profile 

image) are not automatically in violation of the impersonation policy. In order to violate 

our impersonation policy, the account must portray another entity in a misleading or 

deceptive manner.  

An account will not be removed if:  

The user shares your name but has no other commonalities, or  

The profile clearly states it is not affiliated with or connected to any similarly-named 

individuals or brands.  

Twitter users are allowed to create parody, newsfeed, commentary, or fan accounts. Please 

refer to Twitter’s parody, newsfeed, commentary, and fan account policy for more 

information about these types of accounts.  

When does Twitter review accounts under this policy?  

We review impersonation claims upon receipt of a valid impersonation report. We do not 

actively monitor users’ content.  

How do I file an impersonation report?  

If you are the impersonated party or an authorized representative, you can file an 

impersonation report. If you believe an account is impersonating somebody else, you can 

flag it as a bystander by reporting directly from the account’s profile.  

Please note, submitting a report with incomplete information will delay the processing of 

your report.  

Can I request a specific username?  

We generally do not accept individual requests for inactive or suspended usernames.  

What if my trademark is being misused?  

Companies and businesses should report accounts misusing their trademarks by filing a 

complaint under our trademark policy. Please review the trademark policy page for more 

information. 

 

 

**Trademark policy**

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not violate others’ intellectual property rights, including copyright and** **trademark.** 

A trademark is a word, logo, phrase, or device that distinguishes a trademark holder’s good or service in the marketplace. 

Trademark law may prevent others from using a trademark in an unauthorized or confusing manner. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Using another’s trademark in a way that may mislead or confuse people about your affiliation may be a violation of our 

trademark policy. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

Referencing another’s trademark is not automatically a violation of Twitter&aposs trademark policy. Examples of non-violations 

include: 

● 

using a trademark in a way that is outside the scope of the trademark registration e.g., in a different territory, or a 

different class of goods or services than that identified in the registration; and 

● 

using a trademark in a nominative or other fair use manner. For more information, see our parody, newsfeed, 

commentary, and fan account policy. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Twitter only investigates requests that are submitted by the trademark holder or their authorized representative e.g., a 

legal representative or other representative for a brand. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?** 

You can submit a trademark report through our trademark report form. Please provide all the information requested in the 

form. If you submit an incomplete report, we’ll need to follow up about the missing information. Please note that this will 

result in a delay in processing your report. 

**Note:** We may provide the account holder with your name and other information included in the copy of the report. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

If we determine that you violated our trademark policy, we may suspend your account. Depending on the type of violation, 

we may give you an opportunity to comply with our policies. In other instances, an account may be permanently suspended 

upon first review. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal. 

**What is our policy about trademark issues within ads?**

Copyright policy 

 

What Types of Copyright Complaints Does Twitter Respond To? 

Twitter responds to copyright notifications submitted under the Digital Millennium 

Copyright Act (“DMCA”). Section 512 of the DMCA outlines the statutory requirements 

necessary for formally reporting copyright infringement, as well as providing instructions 

on how an affected party can appeal a removal by submitting a compliant counter-notice.  

Twitter will respond to reports of alleged copyright infringement, such as allegations 

concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted image as a profile or header photo, 

allegations concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted video or image uploaded 

through our media hosting services, or Tweets containing links to allegedly infringing 

materials. Note that not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted materials are infringements 

(see our fair use article for more information).  

If you are concerned about the use of your brand or entity’s name, please review Twitter’s 

trademark policy. If you are concerned about the use of a fictional character, please see 

our parody, commentary, and fan accounts policy. These are generally not copyright 

issues.  

Am I a Copyright Holder? How Do I Know?  

If you are unsure whether you hold rights to a particular work, please consult an attorney 

or another adviser as Twitter cannot provide legal advice. There are plenty of resources to 

learn more about copyright law including http://copyright.gov, 

https://lumendatabase.org/, and http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP, to 

name a few.  

Tip: In general, the photographer and NOT the subject of a photograph is the actual rights 

holder of the resulting photograph.  

What Information Do You Need To Process a Copyright Complaint?  

To submit a notice of claimed copyright infringement, you will need to provide us with 

the following information:  

1. A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the 

copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; 

2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (e.g., a link 

to your original work or clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed 

upon); 

3. Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to 

permit Twitter to locate the material on our website or services; 

4. Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email 

address; 

5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the 

manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; 

and 

6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty 

of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. 

If you are reporting the content of a Tweet, please give us a direct link to that Tweet. Or 

please specify if the alleged infringement is in the header, avatar, etc. A LINK TO A 

PROFILE PAGE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR TWITTER TO IDENTIFY INFRINGING 

MATERIALS.  

How Do I File a Copyright Complaint?  

You can report alleged copyright infringement by visiting Twitter’s Help Center and filing 

a copyright report. If you are logged in to twitter.com, you can visit the Twitter Help 

Center directly from your Twitter account by clicking the ‘Help’ link located in the 

sidebar.  

Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will 

be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these 

requirements, we will take action on your request - which includes forwarding a full copy 

of your notice (including your name, address, phone and email address) to the user(s) who 

posted the allegedly infringing material in question.  

If you are concerned about your contact information being fowarded, you may wish to 

use an agent to report for you.  

Please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, 

including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly 

materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing, as was the case in Lenz v. 

Universal and OPG v. Diebold. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting 

is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with 

us.  

How Are Claims Processed?  

We process reports in the order in which they are received. Once you&aposve submitted your 

ticket, we will email you a ticket confirmation. Please note, submitting duplicate 

copyright notices may result in a delay in processing.  

If we decide to remove or disable access to the material, we will notify the affected user(s) 

after removing or disabling access to the material, provide them with a full copy of the 

reporter’s complaint (including the provided contact information) along with instructions 

on how to file a counter-notice, and forward a redacted copy of the complaint to Lumen.  

What Happens Next?  

Twitter’s response to notices of alleged copyright infringement may include the removal 

or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material. If we remove or restrict access to 

user content in response to a notice of alleged infringement, Twitter will make a good 

faith effort to contact the affected account holder with information concerning the 

removal or restriction of access, including a full copy of the takedown notice, along with 

instructions for filing a counter-notification.  

If you’ve not yet received a copy of the copyright notification regarding the content 

removed from your account, please respond to the support ticket we sent you.  

In an effort to be as transparent as possible regarding the removal or restriction of access 

to user-posted content, we clearly mark withheld Tweets and media to indicate to viewers 

when content has been withheld (examples below). We also send a redacted copy of each 

copyright complaint and counter-notice that we process to Lumen, where they are posted 

to a public-facing website (with your personal information removed).  

Under appropriate circumstances, Twitter may suspend and warn repeat violators, and in 

more serious cases, permanently terminate user accounts.  

What Happens If I Receive a Copyright Notification?  

If you receive a copyright notification, it means that the content described in the 

notification has been removed from Twitter or access to the content on Twitter has been 

restricted. Please take the time to read through our notice to you, which includes 

information on the notification we received as well as instructions on how to file a 

counter-notice.  

When Should I File a Counter-notice?  

 

If you believe that the material reported in the copyright notification you received was 

misidentified or removed in error, you should file a counter-notice as per the instructions 

below.  

Re-posting material removed in response to a copyright notification may result in 

permanent account suspension. If you believe the content was removed in error, please 

file a counter-notification rather than simply re-posting the material.  

What Information Do You Need to Process a Counter-notice?  

To submit a counter-notice, you will need to provide us with the following information:  

1. A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice); 

2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been 

disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or 

access to it was disabled (the description from the copyright notice will suffice); 

3. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the 

material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the 

material to be removed or disabled; and 

4. Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to 

the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the 

address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial 

district in which Twitter may be found, and that you will accept service of process 

from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent 

of such person. 

To submit a counter-notice, please respond to our original email notification of the 

removal and include the required information in the body of your reply as we discard all 

attachments for security reasons.  

What Happens After I Submit a Counter-notice?  

Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice, we will promptly forward a copy to the person 

who filed the original notice. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the 

original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material 

at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.  

We cannot offer any legal advice. Should you have questions, please consult an attorney.  

Filing a Copyright Notice or Counter-notice is Serious Business!  

Please think twice before submitting a claim or counter-notice, especially if you are 

unsure whether you are the actual rights holder or authorized to act on a rights holder’s 

behalf. There are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith 

submissions. Please be sure that you are the actual rights holder, or that you have a good 

faith belief that the material was removed in error, and that you understand the 

repercussions of submitting a false claim. 

 

**Our approach to policy development and** 

**enforcement philosophy**

Twitter is reflective of real conversations happening in the world and that sometimes includes perspectives that may be 

offensive, controversial, and/or bigoted to others. While we welcome everyone to express themselves on our service, we 

will not tolerate behavior that harasses, threatens, or uses fear to silence the voices of others. 

We have the Twitter Rules in place to help ensure everyone feels safe expressing their beliefs and we strive to enforce 

them with uniform consistency. Learn more about different enforcement actions. 

**Our policy development process** 

Creating a new policy or making a policy change requires in-depth research around trends in online behavior, developing 

clear external language that sets expectations around what’s allowed, and creating enforcement guidance for reviewers 

that can be scaled across millions of Tweets. 

While drafting policy language, we gather feedback from a variety of internal teams as well as our Trust & Safety Council. 

This is vital to ensure we are considering global perspectives around the changing nature of online speech, including how 

our rules are applied and interpreted in different cultural and social contexts. Finally, we train our global review teams, 

update the Twitter Rules, and start enforcing the new policy. 

**Our enforcement philosophy** 

We empower people to understand different sides of an issue and encourage dissenting opinions and viewpoints to be 

discussed openly. This approach allows many forms of speech to exist on our platform and, in particular, promotes 

counterspeech: speech that presents facts to correct misstatements or misperceptions, points out hypocrisy or 

contradictions, warns of offline or online consequences, denounces hateful or dangerous speech, or helps change minds 

and disarm. 

Thus, **context matters**. When determining whether to take enforcement action, we may consider a number of factors, 

including (but not limited to) whether: 

● 

the behavior is directed at an individual, group, or protected category of people; 

● 

the report has been filed by the target of the abuse or a bystander; 

● 

the user has a history of violating our policies; 

● 

the severity of the violation; 

● 

the content may be a topic of legitimate public interest. 

**Is the behavior directed at an individual or group of people?** 

To strike a balance between allowing different opinions to be expressed on the platform, and protecting our users, we 

enforce policies when someone reports abusive behavior that targets a specific person or group of people. This targeting 

can happen in a number of ways (for example, @mentions, tagging a photo, mentioning them by name, and more). 

**Has the report been filed by the target of the potential abuse or a bystander?** 

Some Tweets may seem to be abusive when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a larger 

conversation or historical relationship between people on the platform. For example, friendly banter between friends could 

appear offensive to bystanders, and certain remarks that are acceptable in one culture or country may not be acceptable in 

another. To help prevent our teams from making a mistake and removing consensual interactions, in certain scenarios we 

require a report from the actual target (or their authorized representative) prior to taking any enforcement action. 

**Does the user have a history of violating our policies?** 

We start from a position of assuming that people do not intend to violate our Rules. Unless a violation is so egregious that 

we must immediately suspend an account, we first try to educate people about our Rules and give them a chance to correct 

their behavior. We show the violator the offending Tweet(s), explain which Rule was broken, and require them to remove 

the content before they can Tweet again. If someone repeatedly violates our Rules then our enforcement actions become 

stronger. This includes requiring violators to remove the Tweet(s) and taking additional actions like verifying account 

ownership and/or temporarily limiting their ability to Tweet for a set period of time. If someone continues to violate Rules 

beyond that point then their account may be permanently suspended. 

**What is the severity of the violation?** 

Certain types of behavior may pose serious safety and security risks and/or result in physical, emotional, and financial 

hardship for the people involved. These egregious violations of the Twitter Rules — such as posting violent threats, non-

consensual intimate media, or content that sexually exploits children — result in the immediate and permanent suspension 

of an account. Other violations could lead to a range of different steps, like requiring someone to remove the offending 

Tweet(s) and/or temporarily limiting their ability to post new Tweet(s). 

**Is the behavior newsworthy and in the legitimate public interest?** 

Twitter moves at the speed of public consciousness and people come to the service to stay informed about what matters. 

Exposure to different viewpoints can help people learn from one another, become more tolerant, and make decisions 

about the type of society we want to live in. 

To help ensure people have an opportunity to see every side of an issue, there may be the rare occasion when we allow 

controversial content or behavior which may otherwise violate our Rules to remain on our service because we believe there 

is a legitimate public interest in its availability. Each situation is evaluated on a case by case basis and ultimately decided 

upon by a cross-functional team. 

Some of the factors that help inform our decision-making about content are the impact it may have on the public, the 

source of the content, and the availability of alternative coverage of an event. 

Public impact of the content: A topic of legitimate public interest is different from a topic in which the public may be 

curious. We will consider what the impact is to citizens if they do **not** know about this content. If the Tweet does have the 

potential to impact the lives of large numbers of people, the running of a country, and/or it speaks to an important societal 

issue then we may allow the the content to remain on the service. Likewise, if the impact on the public is minimal we will 

most likely remove content in violation of our policies. 

Source of the content: Some people, groups, organizations and the content they post on Twitter may be considered a topic 

of legitimate public interest by virtue of their being in the public consciousness. This does not mean that their Tweets will 

always remain on the service. Rather, we will consider if there is a legitimate public interest for a particular Tweet to remain 

up so it can be openly discussed. 

Availability of coverage: Everyday people play a crucial role in providing firsthand accounts of what’s happening in the 

world, counterpoints to establishment views, and, in some cases, exposing the abuse of power by someone in a position of 

authority. As a situation unfolds, removing access to certain information could inadvertently hide context and/or prevent 

people from seeing every side of the issue. Thus, before actioning a potentially violating Tweet, we will take into account 

the role it plays in showing the larger story and whether that content can be found elsewhere.
