Violent threats policy **(20190607*)** 

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the** 

**glorification of violence.** 

Healthy conversation is only possible when people feel safe from abuse and don’t resort to using violent 

language. For this reason, we have a policy against threatening violence on Twitter. We define violent threats as 

statements of an intent to kill or inflict serious physical harm on a specific person or group of people. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy, you can’t state an intention to inflict violence on a specific person or group of people. We 

define intent to include statements like “I will”, “I’m going to”, or “I plan to”, as well as conditional statements like 

“If you do X, I will”. Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to: 

• 

threatening to kill someone; 

• 

threatening to sexually assault someone; 

• 

threatening to seriously hurt someone and/or commit a other violent act that could lead to someone’s 

death or serious physical injury; and 

• 

asking for or offering a financial reward in exchange for inflicting violence on a specific person or group 

of people. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

We recognize that some people use violent language as part of hyperbolic speech or between friends, so we also 

allow some forms of violent speech where it’s clear that there is no abusive or violent intent, e.g., “I’ll kill you for 

sending me that plot spoiler!”. 

This policy is enforced in tandem with our policies on abusive behavior and hateful conduct. Statements that 

express a wish or hope that someone experiences physical harm, making vague or indirect threats, or threatening 

actions that are unlikely to cause serious or lasting injury are not actionable under this policy, but may be 

reviewed and actioned under those policies. **Note:** we also have a policy against encouraging self-harm and 

suicide. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have a Twitter account or not.

**Glorification of violence policy**

(20190407*)

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the** 

**glorification of violence.** 

Glorifying violent acts could inspire others to take part in similar acts of violence. Additionally, glorifying violent 

events where people were targeted on the basis of their protected characteristics (including: race, ethnicity, 

national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease) 

could incite or lead to further violence motivated by hatred and intolerance. For these reasons, we have a policy 

against content that glorifies acts of violence in a way that may inspire others to replicate those violent acts and 

cause real offline harm, or events where members of a protected group were the primary targets or victims. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy, you can’t glorify, celebrate, praise or condone violent crimes, violent events where people were 

targeted because of their membership in a protected group, or the perpetrators of such acts. We define 

glorification to include praising, celebrating, or condoning statements, such as “I’m glad this happened”, “This 

person is my hero”, “I wish more people did things like this”, or “I hope this inspires others to act”. 

Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to, glorifying, praising, condoning, or celebrating: 

• 

violent acts committed by civilians that resulted in death or serious physical injury, e.g., murders, mass 

shootings; 

• 

attacks carried out by terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups (as defined by our terrorism and 

violent extremism policy); and 

• 

violent events that targeted protected groups, e.g., the Holocaust, Rwandan genocide. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

Our focus is on preventing the glorification of violence that could inspire others to replicate violent acts, as well as 

violent events where protected groups were the primary targets or victims. Exceptions may be made for violent 

acts by state actors, where violence was not primarily targeting protected groups. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have a Twitter account or not. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?**

**Report form** 

You can also report this content for review via our abusive behavior reporting form, by selecting 

the **Harassment** option. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

The consequences for violating our glorification of violence policy depends on the severity of the violation and 

the account’s previous history of violations. 

The first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you 

out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you continue to violate this policy after receiving a warning, 

your account will be permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you 

can submit an appeal.

**Violent organizations policy**(20201026*)

**Overview** 

**October 2020** 

There is no place on Twitter for violent organizations, including terrorist organizations, violent extremist groups, or 

individuals who affiliate with and promote their illicit activities. The violence that these groups engage in and/or 

promote jeopardizes the physical safety and well-being of those targeted. Our assessments under this policy are 

informed by national and international terrorism designations, as well as our violent extremist group and violent 

organizations criteria. 

**You may not threaten or promote terrorism or violent extremism.**  

There is no place on Twitter for violent organizations, including terrorist organizations, violent extremist groups, or 

individuals who affiliate with and promote their illicit activities. The violence that these groups engage in and/or 

promote jeopardizes the physical safety and well-being of those targeted. Our assessments under this policy are 

informed by national and international terrorism designations, as well as our violent extremist group and violent 

organizations criteria. 

Violent extremist groups are those that meet all of the below criteria: 

• 

identify through their stated purpose, publications, or actions as an extremist group; 

• 

have engaged in, or currently engage in, violence and/or the promotion of violence as a means to further 

their cause; and 

• 

target civilians in their acts and/or promotion of violence. 

**Other violent organizations** 

Other violent organizations are those that meet all of the below criteria: 

• 

a collection of individuals with a shared purpose; and 

• 

have systematically targeted civilians with violence. 

We examine a group’s activities both on and off Twitter to determine whether they satisfy the above criteria. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy, you can’t affiliate with and promote the illicit activities of a terrorist organization or violent 

extremist group. Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to: 

• 

engaging in or promoting acts on behalf of a violent organization; 

• 

recruiting for a violent organization; 

• 

providing or distributing services (e.g., financial, media/propaganda) to further a violent organization’s 

stated goals; and 

• 

using the insignia or symbol of violent organizations to promote them or indicate affiliation or support. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

We may make limited exceptions for groups that have reformed or are currently engaging in a peaceful resolution 

process, as well as groups with representatives who have been elected to public office through democratic 

elections. We may also make exceptions related to the discussion of terrorism or extremism for clearly educational 

or documentary purposes. This policy also doesn’t apply to state or governmental organizations.

**Child sexual exploitation policy** 

**(20201012*)**

**Overview** 

**October 2020** 

**We have a zero-tolerance child sexual exploitation policy on Twitter.** 

Twitter has **zero tolerance towards any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation**, one of 

the most serious violations of the Twitter Rules. This may include media, text, illustrated, or computer-generated 

images. Regardless of the intent, viewing, sharing, or linking to child sexual exploitation material contributes to 

the re-victimization of the depicted children. This also applies to content that may further contribute to 

victimization of children through the promotion or glorification of child sexual exploitation. For the purposes of 

this policy, a minor is any person under the age of 18. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Any content that depicts or promotes child sexual exploitation including, but not limited to: 

• 

visual depictions of a child engaging in sexually explicit or sexually suggestive acts; 

• 

illustrated, computer-generated or other forms of realistic depictions of a human child in a sexually 

explicit context, or engaging in sexually explicit acts; 

• 

sexualized commentaries about or directed at a known or unknown minor; and 

• 

links to third-party sites that host child sexual exploitation material. 

The following behaviors are also not permitted: 

• 

sharing fantasies about or promoting engagement in child sexual exploitation; 

• 

expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation; 

• 

recruiting, advertising or expressing an interest in a commercial sex act involving a child, or in harboring 

and/or transporting a child for sexual purposes; 

• 

sending sexually explicit media to a child; 

• 

engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation; 

• 

trying to obtain sexually explicit media from a child or trying to engage a child in sexual activity through 

blackmail or other incentives; 

• 

identifying alleged victims of childhood sexual exploitation by name or image; and 

• 

promoting or normalizing sexual attraction to minors as a form of identity or sexual orientation. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

• 

Discussions related to child sexual exploitation are permitted, provided they don’t normalise, promote or 

glorify child sexual exploitation **in any way**; 

• 

Conversations about help-seeking behaviour of individuals who may struggle with an attraction to 

minors; 

• 

Advocacy against illegal or harmful activity involving minors provided there is no sharing of, or linking to 

any material featuring child sexual exploitation; and 

• 

Depictions of nude minors in a non-sexualized context or setting may be permitted in a limited number 

of scenarios (e.g., art works by internationally renowned artists that feature minors, news media 

reportage, media created and shared for scientific or educational purposes). 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have a Twitter account or not. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?** 

If you think you&aposve found a Twitter account distributing or promoting child sexual exploitation, you can report it 

via our child sexual exploitation form. Provide the username and links to all relevant Tweets that led you to believe 

the account should be reviewed. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

In the majority of cases, the consequence for violating our child sexual exploitation policy is **immediate and** 

**permanent suspension**. In addition, violators will be prohibited from creating any new accounts in the future. 

Note: when we’re made aware of content depicting or promoting child sexual exploitation, including links to third 

party sites where this content can be accessed, they will be removed without further notice and reported to the 

National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). 

In a limited number of situations, where we haven’t identified any malicious intent, we will require you to remove 

this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. Further violations 

will lead to your account being permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, 

you can submit an appeal. 

**Additional resources** 

Learn more about our range of enforcement options and our approach to policy development and enforcement. 

If you’ve found content elsewhere on the internet that is distributing or promoting child sexual exploitation, you 

should file a report with NCMEC, or with your local law enforcement. If you believe the content is hosted on a 

website outside of the United States, you can report it on the International Association of Internet Hotlines 

website. 

We partner with multiple organisations whose work is dedicated to fighting child sexual exploitation around the 

world. Please see the full list of our child protection partners. 

 

**Abusive behavior (20210527*)**

Twitter Rules: You may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so. We 

consider abusive behavior an attempt to harass, intimidate, or silence someone else’s voice. 

**Rationale** 

On Twitter, you should feel safe expressing your unique point of view. We believe in freedom of expression and 

open dialogue, but that means little as an underlying philosophy if voices are silenced because people are afraid 

to speak up. 

In order to facilitate healthy dialogue on the platform, and empower individuals to express diverse opinions and 

beliefs, we prohibit behavior that harasses or intimidates, or is otherwise intended to shame or degrade others. In 

addition to posing risks to people’s safety, abusive behavior may also lead to physical and emotional hardship for 

those affected. 

Learn more about our approach to policy development and our enforcement philosophy. 

**When this applies** 

Some Tweets may seem to be abusive when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a 

larger conversation. When we review this type of content, it may not be clear whether it is intended to harass an 

individual, or if it is part of a consensual conversation. To help our teams understand the context of a 

conversation, we may need to hear directly from the person being targeted, to ensure that we have the 

information needed prior to taking any enforcement action. 

We will review and take action against reports of accounts targeting an individual or group of people with any of 

the following behavior within Tweets or Direct Messages. For accounts engaging in abusive behavior on their 

profile, please refer to our abusive profile policy. For behavior targeting people based on their race, ethnicity, 

national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease, 

this may be in violation of our hateful conduct policy. 

**Wishing, hoping, or calling for serious harm on a person or group of people** 

We do not tolerate content that wishes, hopes, promotes, incites, or expresses a desire for death, serious bodily 

harm or serious disease against an individual or group of people. This includes, but is not limited to: 

• 

Hoping that someone dies as a result of a serious disease e.g., “I hope you get cancer and die.” 

• 

Wishing for someone to fall victim to a serious accident e.g., “I wish that you would get run over by a car 

next time you run your mouth.” 

• 

Saying that a group of individuals deserves serious physical injury e.g., “If this group of protesters don’t 

shut up, they deserve to be shot.” 

**About wishes of harm exceptions on Twitter** 

We recognize that conversations regarding certain individuals credibly accused of severe violence may prompt 

outrage and associated wishes of harm. In these limited cases, we will request the user to delete the Tweet 

without any risk of account penalty, strike, or suspension. Examples are, but not limited to: 

• 

 “I wish all rapists to die.” 

• 

“Child abusers should be hanged.” 

**Unwanted sexual advances** 

While some consensual nudity and adult content is permitted on Twitter, we prohibit unwanted sexual advances 

and content that sexually objectifies an individual without their consent. This includes, but is not limited to: 

• 

sending someone unsolicited and/or unwanted adult media, including images, videos, and GIFs; 

• 

unwanted sexual discussion of someone’s body; 

• 

solicitation of sexual acts; and 

• 

any other content that otherwise sexualizes an individual without their consent. 

**Using aggressive insults with the purpose of harassing or intimidating others** 

We take action against excessively aggressive insults that target an individual, including content that contains 

slurs or similar language. Please also note that while some individuals may find certain terms to be offensive, we 

will not action against every instance where insulting terms are used. 

**Encouraging or calling for others to harass an individual or group of people** 

We prohibit behavior that encourages others to harass or target specific individuals or groups with abusive 

behavior. This includes, but is not limited to; calls to target people with abuse or harassment online and behavior 

that urges offline action such as physical harassment. 

**Denying mass casualty events took place** 

We prohibit content that denies that mass murder or other mass casualty events took place, where we can verify 

that the event occured, and when the content is shared with abusive intent. This may include references to such 

an event as a "hoax" or claims that victims or survivors are fake or "actors." It includes, but is not limited to, 

events like the Holocaust, school shootings, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters. 

**Do I need to be the target of this content for it to be reviewed for violating the Twitter Rules?** 

No, we review both first-person and bystander reports of such content. 

**Consequences** 

When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited 

to, the severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. 

For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode 

before they can Tweet again. Subsequent violations will lead to longer read-only periods and may eventually 

result in permanent suspension. If an account is engaging primarily in abusive behavior, we may permanently 

suspend the account upon initial review. 

Learn more about our range of enforcement options. 

 

**Hateful conduct policy** **(20210127*)** 

**Hateful conduct:** You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis 

of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, 

disability, or serious disease. We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards 

others on the basis of these categories. 

**Hateful imagery and display names:** You may not use hateful images or symbols in your profile image or profile 

header. You also may not use your username, display name, or profile bio to engage in abusive behavior, such as 

targeted harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group, or protected category. 

**Rationale** 

Twitter’s mission is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, and to express their 

opinions and beliefs without barriers. Free expression is a human right – we believe that everyone has a voice, and 

the right to use it. Our role is to serve the public conversation, which requires representation of a diverse range of 

perspectives. 

We recognize that if people experience abuse on Twitter, it can jeopardize their ability to express themselves. 

Research has shown that some groups of people are disproportionately targeted with abuse online. This includes; 

women, people of color, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual individuals, marginalized and 

historically underrepresented communities. For those who identify with multiple underrepresented groups, abuse 

may be more common, more severe in nature and more harmful. 

We are committed to combating abuse motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, particularly abuse that 

seeks to silence the voices of those who have been historically marginalized. For this reason, we prohibit behavior 

that targets individuals with abuse based on protected category. 

If you see something on Twitter that you believe violates our hateful conduct policy, please report it to us. 

**When this applies** 

We will review and take action against reports of accounts targeting an individual or group of people with any of 

the following behavior, whether within Tweets or Direct Messages. 

**Violent threats** 

We prohibit content that makes violent threats against an identifiable target. Violent threats are declarative 

statements of intent to inflict injuries that would result in serious and lasting bodily harm, where an individual 

could die or be significantly injured, e.g., “I will kill you.” 

**Note:** we have a zero tolerance policy against violent threats. Those deemed to be sharing violent threats will face 

immediate and permanent suspension of their account. 

**Wishing, hoping or calling for serious harm on a person or group of people** 

We prohibit content that wishes, hopes, promotes, incites, or expresses a desire for death, serious bodily harm, or 

serious disease against an entire protected category and/or individuals who may be members of that category. 

This includes, but is not limited to: 

• 

Hoping that an entire protected category and/or individuals who may be members of that category dies 

as a result of a serious disease, e.g., “I hope all [nationality] get COVID and die.” 

• 

Wishing for someone to fall victim to a serious accident, e.g., “I wish that you would get run over by a car 

next time you run your mouth.” 

• 

Saying that a group of individuals deserve serious physical injury, e.g., “If this group of [slur] don’t shut 

up, they deserve to be shot.” 

• 

Encouraging others to commit violence against an individual or a group based on their perceived 

membership in a protected category, e.g., “I’m in the mood to punch a [racial slur], who’s with me?” 

**References to mass murder, violent events, or specific means of violence where protected groups have** 

**been the primary targets or victims** 

We prohibit targeting individuals with content that references forms of violence or violent events where a 

protected category was the primary target or victims, where the intent is to harass. This includes, but is not limited 

to sending someone: 

• 

media that depicts victims of the Holocaust; 

• 

media that depicts lynchings. 

**Incitement against protected categories** 

We prohibit inciting behavior that targets individuals or groups of people belonging to protected categories. This 

includes content intended: 

• 

to incite fear or spread fearful stereotypes about a protected category, including asserting that members 

of a protected category are more likely to take part in dangerous or illegal activities, e.g., “all [religious 

group] are terrorists.” 

• 

to incite others to harass members of a protected category on or off platform, e.g., “I’m sick of these 

[religious group] thinking they are better than us, if any of you see someone wearing a [religious symbol 

of the religious group], grab it off them and post pics!“ 

• 

to incite others to discriminate in the form of denial of support to the economic enterprise of an 

individual or group because of their perceived membership in a protected category, e.g., “If you go to a 

[religious group] store, you are supporting those [slur], let’s stop giving our money to these [religious 

slur].” This may not include content intended as political in nature, such as political commentary or 

content relating to boycotts or protests. 

Note that content intended to incite violence against a protected category is prohibited under **Wishing, hoping,** 

**or calling for serious harm on a person or groups of people.** 

We prohibit targeting individuals and groups with content intended to incite fear or spread fearful stereotypes 

about a protected category, including asserting that members of a protected category are more likely to take part 

in dangerous or illegal activities, e.g., “all [religious group] are terrorists.” 

**Repeated and/or non-consensual slurs, epithets, racist and sexist tropes, or other content that degrades** 

**someone** 

We prohibit targeting individuals with repeated slurs, tropes or other content that intends to dehumanize, 

degrade or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected category. This includes targeted 

misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals. 

We also prohibit the dehumanization of a group of people based on their religion, caste, age, disability, serious 

disease, national origin, race, or ethnicity. 

**Hateful imagery** 

We consider hateful imagery to be logos, symbols, or images whose purpose is to promote hostility and malice 

against others based on their race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or ethnicity/national 

origin. Some examples of hateful imagery include, but are not limited to: 

• 

symbols historically associated with hate groups, e.g., the Nazi swastika; 

• 

images depicting others as less than human, or altered to include hateful symbols, e.g., altering images 

of individuals to include animalistic features; or 

• 

images altered to include hateful symbols or references to a mass murder that targeted a protected 

category, e.g., manipulating images of individuals to include yellow Star of David badges, in reference to 

the Holocaust. 

Media depicting hateful imagery is not permitted within live video, account bio, profile or header images. All other 

instances must be marked as sensitive media. Additionally, sending an individual unsolicited hateful imagery is a 

violation of our abusive behavior policy. 

**Do I need to be the target of this content for it to be a violation of the** 

**Twitter Rules?** 

Some Tweets may appear to be hateful when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a 

larger conversation. For example, members of a protected category may refer to each other using terms that are 

typically considered as slurs. When used consensually, the intent behind these terms is not abusive, but a means 

to reclaim terms that were historically used to demean individuals. 

When we review this type of content, it may not be clear whether the intention is to abuse an individual on the 

basis of their protected status, or if it is part of a consensual conversation. To help our teams understand the 

context, we sometimes need to hear directly from the person being targeted to ensure that we have the 

information needed prior to taking any enforcement action. 

**Note:** individuals do not need to be a member of a specific protected category for us to take action. We will never 

ask people to prove or disprove membership in any protected category and we will not investigate this 

information. 

**Consequences** 

Under this policy, we take action against behavior that targets individuals or an entire protected category with 

hateful conduct, as described above. Targeting can happen in a number of ways, for example, mentions, including 

a photo of an individual, referring to someone by their full name, etc. 

When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited 

to the severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. For example, we may ask 

someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can Tweet 

again. Subsequent violations will lead to longer read-only periods and may eventually result in permanent account 

suspension. If an account is engaging primarily in abusive behavior, or is deemed to have shared a violent threat, 

we will permanently suspend the account upon initial review. 

Learn more about our range of enforcement options. 

If someone believes their account was suspended in error, they can submit an appeal. 

 

**Suicide and Self-harm Policy**

**(20200805*)**

Overview 

**You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.** 

At Twitter, we recognize that suicide and self-harm are significant social & public health challenges that require 

collaboration between all stakeholders – public, private, and civil society – and that we have a role and 

responsibility to help people access and receive support when they need it. 

When developing this policy, we consulted extensively with experts to ensure that people who have engaged in 

self-harm or experienced suicidal thoughts can share their personal experiences. We also recognized the need to 

protect people from the potential harm caused by exposure to content that could promote or encourage self-

harm – intentionally or inadvertently. That’s why our policy prohibits content that promotes or encourages self-

harming behaviors and provides support to those undergoing experiences with self-harm or suicidal thoughts. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy, you can’t promote, or otherwise encourage, suicide or self-harm. We define promotion and 

encouragement to include statements such as “the most effective”, “the easiest”, “the best”, “the most successful”, 

“you should”, “why don’t you”. Violations of this policy can occur via Tweets, images or videos, including live 

video. 

We define suicide to be the act of taking one’s own life. We define self-harm to include: 

• 

self-inflicted physical injuries e.g., cutting; and 

• 

eating disorders e.g., bulimia, anorexia. 

Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to: 

• 

encouraging someone to physically harm or kill themselves; 

• 

asking others for encouragement to engage in self-harm or suicide, including seeking partners for group 

suicides or suicide games; and 

• 

sharing information, strategies, methods or instructions that would assist people to engage in self-harm 

and suicide. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

Some examples of behavior that are not considered a violation of this policy include: 

• 

sharing personal stories and experiences related to self-harm or suicide; 

• 

sharing coping mechanisms and resources for addressing self-harm or suicidal thoughts; and 

• 

discussions that are focused on research, advocacy, and education related to self-harm or suicide 

prevention. 

**Note**: people can share their personal experiences, but should avoid sharing detailed information about specific 

strategies or methods related to self-harm, as this could inadvertently encourage this behavior. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report content that may encourage or promote suicide or self-harm via our in-app reporting or 

our specialized reporting form. These reports are routed to a dedicated team who evaluate each case individually. 

Note: if we receive a report that someone has expressed an intention to engage in self-harm or suicide, we will 

contact them directly, encourage them to seek support, and provide information about dedicated online and 

hotline resources. We may also work with law enforcement officials where appropriate, for example, if we receive a 

valid emergency disclosure request as defined in our Law Enforcement Guidelines. 

**How to report violations of this policy** 

To ensure that we handle reports sensitively, our in-app reporting provides separate options for people who may 

be expressing an intention to harm themselves, and content that is encouraging or promoting self-harm or 

suicide.

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

Our enforcement approach depends on the type of content being shared, whether or not the reported account is 

encouraging or promoting self-harm or suicide, and the account’s previous history of violations. 

If you violate this policy by sharing content that intentionally encourages others to harm themselves, ask others to 

encourage you to harm yourself, or share detailed information or instructions related to self-harm or suicide 

methods, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before 

you can Tweet again. If you continue to violate this policy, or if your account is dedicated to promoting or 

encouraging self-harm or suicide, your account will be permanently suspended. If cases include images or videos 

related to self-harm or suicide, we will also evaluate this content under our sensitive media policy. If you believe 

that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal. 

We may also take steps to prevent the spread of instructional material hosted on third-party websites by marking 

such links as unsafe.

**Sensitive media policy** **(20191204*)** 

**Overview** 

**November 2019** 

**You may not post media that is excessively gory or share violent or adult content within live video or in** 

**profile or header images. Media depicting sexual violence and/or assault is also not permitted.** 

People use Twitter to show what’s happening in the world, often sharing images and videos as part of the 

conversation. Sometimes, this media can depict sensitive topics, including violent and adult content. We recognize 

that some people may not want to be exposed to sensitive content, which is why we balance allowing people to 

share this type of media with helping people who want to avoid it to do so. 

For this reason, you can’t include violent, hateful, or adult content within areas that are highly visible on Twitter, 

including in live video, profile or header images. If you share this content within Tweets, you need to mark your 

account as sensitive. Doing so places images and videos behind an interstitial (or warning message), that needs to 

be acknowledged before your media can be viewed. Using this feature means that people who don’t want to see 

sensitive media can avoid it, or make an informed decision before they choose to view it. 

Under this policy, there are also some types of sensitive media content that we don’t allow at all, because they 

have the potential to normalize violence and cause distress to those who view them. 

We group sensitive media content into the following categories: 

**Graphic violence** 

Graphic violence is any media that depicts death, violence, medical procedures, or serious physical injury in 

graphic detail. Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of: 

• 

violent crimes or accidents; 

• 

physical fights; 

• 

physical child abuse; 

• 

bodily fluids including blood, feces, semen etc.; 

• 

serious physical harm, including visible wounds; and 

• 

severely injured or mutilated animals. 

**Note:** exceptions may be made for documentary or educational content. 

**Adult content** 

Adult content is any consensually produced and distributed media that is pornographic or intended to cause 

sexual arousal. Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of: 

• 

full or partial nudity, including close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or breasts (excluding content related to 

breastfeeding); 

• 

simulated sexual acts; and 

• 

sexual intercourse or other sexual acts – this also applies to cartoons, hentai, or anime involving humans 

or depictions of animals with human-like features. 

**Note:** exceptions may be made for artistic, medical, health, or educational content. 

For content that was created or distributed without the consent of those featured, please refer to our non-

consensual nudity policy. 

**Violent sexual conduct** 

Violent sexual conduct is any media that depicts violence, whether real or simulated, in association with sexual 

acts. Some examples include, but are not limited to, depictions of: 

• 

rape and other forms of violent sexual assault, or sexual acts that occur without the consent of 

participants, including a simulated lack of consent; and 

• 

sexualized violence – inflicting physical harm on an individual within an intimate setting, where it is not 

immediately obvious if those involved have consented to take part. 

**Gratuitous gore** 

Gratuitous gore is any media that depicts excessively graphic or gruesome content related to death, violence or 

severe physical harm, or violent content that is shared for sadistic purposes. Some examples include, but are not 

limited to, depictions of: 

• 

dismembered or mutilated humans; 

• 

charred or burned human remains; 

• 

exposed internal organs or bones; and 

• 

animal torture or killing. **Note:** exceptions may be made for religious sacrifice, food preparation or 

processing, and hunting. 

**Hateful imagery** 

Hateful imagery is any logo, symbol, or image that has the intention to promote hostility against people on the 

basis of race, religious affiliation, disability, sexual orientation, gender/gender identity or ethnicity/national origin. 

Some examples of hateful imagery include, but are not limited to: 

• 

symbols historically associated with hate groups, e.g., the Nazi swastika; 

• 

images depicting others as less than human, or altered to include hateful symbols, e.g., altering images 

of individuals to include animalistic features; or 

• 

images altered to include hateful symbols or references to a mass murder that targeted a protected 

category, e.g., manipulating images of individuals to include yellow Star of David badges, in reference to 

the Holocaust. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Our aim is to limit exposure to sensitive images and videos and to prevent the sharing of potentially disturbing 

types of sensitive media. For this reason, we differentiate our enforcement approach depending on the type of 

media that has been shared and where it has been shared. 

**Graphic violence, adult content, and hateful imagery** 

• 

you can’t target people with unsolicited images or videos that contain graphic violence, adult content, or 

hateful imagery; and 

• 

you can’t include graphic violence, adult content, or hateful imagery within live video, profile, or header 

images. 

**Violent sexual conduct and gratuitous gore** 

We prohibit violent sexual conduct to prevent the normalization of sexual assault and non-consensual violence 

associated with sexual acts. We prohibit gratuitous gore content because research has shown that repeated 

exposure to violent content online may negatively impact an individual’s wellbeing. For these reasons, you can’t 

share images or videos that depict violent sexual conduct or gratuitous gore on Twitter. **Note:** very limited 

exceptions may be made for gory media associated with newsworthy events. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

You can share graphic violence and consensually produced adult content within your Tweets, provided that you 

mark this media as sensitive. We may also allow limited sharing of hateful imagery, provided that it is not used to 

promote a terrorist or violent extremist group, that you mark this content as sensitive and don’t target it at an 

individual (via mentioning someone or including an identifiable individual within such images). 

To mark your media as sensitive, navigate to your safety settings and select the **Mark media you Tweet as** 

**containing material that may be sensitive** option. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we will do so 

manually if your content is reported for review. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report potential violations of this policy via our dedicated reporting flows. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?** 

**In-app** 

You can report this content for review in-app as follows: 

1. 

Select **Report Tweet** from the icon.

1. 

Select **Report Tweet** from the icon. 

2. 

Select **It displays a sensitive photo or video**. 

3. 

Select the relevant option depending on what you are reporting. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

The enforcement action we take depends on the type of media you have shared, and where you have shared it. 

**Graphic violence, adult content, and hateful imagery** 

• 

live video and profile images – the first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this 

content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you violate 

this policy again after your first warning, your account will be permanently suspended; 

• 

sending someone unsolicited violent or adult content – if you target someone with sensitive media in a 

clearly abusive or unsolicited way, we’ll require you to remove it under our abusive behavior policy; and 

• 

accounts dedicated to posting sensitive media – your account may be permanently suspended if the 

majority of your activity on Twitter is sharing sensitive media. 

If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal. 

**Violent sexual conduct and gratuitous gore** 

• 

if you share media that depicts violent sexual conduct or gratuitous gore anywhere on Twitter, we will 

require you to remove this content. 

• 

if your account is dedicated to posting this type of content, your account will be immediately 

permanently suspended. 

If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal.

**Illegal or certain regulated goods or** 

**services**(20190607*) 

**Overview** 

**April 2019** 

**You may not use our service for any unlawful purpose or in furtherance of illegal activities. This includes** 

**selling, buying, or facilitating transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated** 

**goods or services.**  

Twitter takes the safety of our users seriously. In an effort to address the potential for real-world harm, we do not 

allow the use of Twitter for any unlawful behavior or to further illegal activities. This includes selling, buying, or 

facilitating transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or services. In some 

cases, we may ask you to contact a law enforcement agency and have them contact us via our law enforcement 

request page to ensure we have enough context to enforce this policy. In addition to reports received, we 

proactively surface activity that may violate this policy for human review. 

Goods or services covered under this policy include, but are not limited to: 

• 

counterfeit goods and services*; 

• 

drugs and controlled substances; 

• 

human trafficking; 

• 

products made from endangered or protected species; 

• 

sexual services; 

• 

stolen goods; and 

• 

weapons, including firearms, ammunition, and explosives, and instructions on making weapons (e.g. 

bombs, 3D printed guns, etc.) 

*Learn more about our counterfeit policy. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

The consequences for violating this policy depends on the severity of the violation and the account’s previous 

history of violations. 

If you violate this policy more than once and/or if your account is dedicated to the sale of illegal or regulated 

goods and/or services, your account may be suspended permanently. 

Accounts that appear to be using misleading account information in order to engage in spamming, abusive, or 

disruptive behavior to promote the sale of illegal and regulated goods and/or services may be subject to 

suspension under our platform manipulation and spam policy. 

If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal.

**Private information policy**(20190607*)

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not publish or post other people&aposs private information without their express authorization and** 

**permission. We also prohibit threatening to expose private information or incentivizing others to do so.** 

Sharing someone’s private information online without their permission, sometimes called doxxing, is a breach of 

their privacy and of the Twitter Rules. Sharing private information can pose serious safety and security risks for 

those affected and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship. 

When reviewing reports under this policy, we consider a number of things, including: 

**What type of information is being shared?** 

We consider this because certain types of private information carry higher risks than others, if they’re shared 

without permission. Our primary aim is to protect individuals from coming to physical harm as a result of their 

information being shared, so we consider information like physical location to be a higher risk than other types of 

information. 

**Who is sharing the information?** 

We also consider who is sharing the reported information and whether or not they have the consent of the person 

it belongs to. We do this because we know that there are times when people may want some forms of their 

personal information to be shared publicly. For example, sharing a personal phone number or email for 

professional networking or to coordinate social events or publicly sharing someone’s home addresses to seek 

help after a natural disaster. 

**Is the information available elsewhere online?** 

If the reported information was shared somewhere else before it was shared on Twitter, e.g., someone sharing 

their personal phone number on their own publicly accessible website, we may not treat this information as 

private, as the owner has made it publicly available. Note: we may take action against home addresses being 

shared, even if they are publicly available, due to the potential for physical harm. 

**Why is the information being shared?** 

We also factor in the intent of the person sharing the information. For example, if we believe that someone is 

sharing information with an abusive intent, or to harass or encourage others to harass another person, we will 

take action. On the other hand, if someone is sharing information in an effort to help someone involved in a crisis 

situation like in the aftermath of a violent event, we may not take action. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy, you can’t share the following types of private information, without the permission of the person 

who it belongs to: 

• 

home address or physical location information, including street addresses, GPS coordinates or other 

identifying information related to locations that are considered private; 

• 

identity documents, including government-issued IDs and social security or other national identity 

numbers – note: we may make limited exceptions in regions where this information is not considered to 

be private; 

• 

contact information, including non-public personal phone numbers or email addresses; 

• 

financial account information, including bank account and credit card details; and 

• 

other private information, including biometric data or medical records. 

The following behaviors are also not permitted: 

• 

threatening to publicly expose someone’s private information; 

• 

sharing information that would enable individuals to hack or gain access to someone’s private 

information without their consent,e.g., sharing sign-in credentials for online banking services; 

• 

asking for or offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for posting someone’s private 

information; 

• 

asking for a bounty or financial reward in exchange for not posting someone’s private information, 

sometimes referred to as blackmail. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

The following are not in violation of this policy: 

• 

people sharing their own private information; 

• 

sharing information that is publicly available elsewhere, in a non-abusive manner; and 

• 

sharing information that we don’t consider to be private, including: 

o 

name; 

o 

birthdate or age; 

o 

place of education or employment; 

o 

location information related to commercial property or places of business, where this 

information is publicly available; 

o 

descriptions of physical appearance; 

o 

gossip, rumours, accusations, and allegations; and 

o 

screenshots of text messages or messages from other platforms (unless they contain private 

information e.g., phone number). 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Anyone can report private information that has been shared in a clearly abusive way (whether they have a Twitter 

account or not). In cases where the information hasn’t been shared with a clearly abusive intent, we need to hear 

directly from the owner of this information (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) before taking 

enforcement action.

**Non-consensual nudity policy**

**(20191217*)**

**Overview** 

**November 2019** 

**You may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed** 

**without their consent.** 

Sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their consent is a severe violation of their 

privacy and the Twitter Rules. Sometimes referred to as revenge porn, this content poses serious safety and 

security risks for people affected and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship. 

**What is a violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy, you can’t post or share explicit images or videos that were taken, appear to have been taken or 

that were shared without the consent of the people involved. 

Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to: 

• 

hidden camera content featuring nudity, partial nudity, and/or sexual acts; 

• 

creepshots or upskirts - images or videos taken of people’s buttocks, up an individual’s skirt/dress or 

other clothes that allows people to see the person’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts; 

• 

images or videos that superimpose or otherwise digitally manipulate an individual’s face onto another 

person’s nude body; 

• 

images or videos that are taken in an intimate setting and not intended for public distribution; and 

• 

offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for intimate images or videos. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

Pornography and other forms of consensually produced adult content are allowed on Twitter, provided that this 

media is marked as sensitive. Doing so provides people who may not want to see this type of content with a 

warning that they will need to acknowledge before viewing your media. 

To mark your media as sensitive, navigate to your safety settings and select the **Mark media you Tweet as** 

**containing material that may be sensitive** option. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we may do so 

manually if your content is reported for review. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Because Twitter allows some types of adult content, we need to evaluate context to assess if reported content has 

been created or shared without the consent of those involved. 

**Content reportable by anyone** 

We recognize that it can be difficult for those impacted to report this type of content for review. To reduce the 

burden on those affected, anyone can report the following types of content: 

• 

creepshots or upskirts; 

• 

content where a bounty or financial reward is offered in exchange for non-consensual nudity media; and 

• 

intimate images or videos that are accompanied by: 

• 

text that wishes/hopes for harm to come to those depicted or otherwise refers to revenge e.g., “I hope 

you get what you deserve when people see this”; and 

• 

information that could be used to contact those depicted e.g., “You can tell my ex what you think by 

calling them on 1234567”. 

**Content reportable by featured individual(s)** 

For other types of content, we may need to hear directly from the individual(s) featured (or an authorized 

representative, such as a lawyer) to ensure that we have sufficient context before taking any enforcement action. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?** 

**In-app** 

You can report this content for review in-app as follows: 

1. 

Select **Report Tweet** from the icon.

**Report form** 

You can also report this content via our private information report form, by selecting the **An unauthorized photo** 

**or video** option. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

We will **immediately and permanently suspend any account that we identify as the original poster of** 

**intimate media** that was created or shared without consent. We will do the same with any account that posts 

only this type of content, e.g., accounts dedicated to sharing upskirt images. 

In other cases, we may not suspend an account immediately. This is because some people share this content 

inadvertently, to express shock, disbelief or to denounce this practice. In these cases, we will require you to 

remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you 

violate this policy again after your first warning, your account will be permanently suspended. If you believe that 

your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal.

**Platform manipulation and spam policy**

**(20200918*)** 

**Overview** 

**September 2020** 

**You may not use Twitter’s services in a manner intended** **to artificially amplify or suppress information or** 

**engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience on Twitter.** 

We want Twitter to be a place where people can make human connections, find reliable information, and express 

themselves freely and safely. To make that possible, we do not allow spam or other types of platform 

manipulation. We define platform manipulation as using Twitter to engage in bulk, aggressive, or deceptive 

activity that misleads others and/or disrupts their experience. 

Platform manipulation can take many forms and our rules are intended to address a wide range of prohibited 

behavior, including: 

• 

commercially-motivated spam, that typically aims to drive traffic or attention from a conversation on 

Twitter to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives; 

• 

inauthentic engagements, that attempt to make accounts or content appear more popular or active than 

they are; 

• 

coordinated activity, that attempts to artificially influence conversations through the use of multiple 

accounts, fake accounts, automation and/or scripting; and 

• 

coordinated harmful activity that encourages or promotes behavior which violates the Twitter Rules. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Under this policy we prohibit a range of behaviors in the following areas: 

**Accounts and identity** 

**You can’t mislead others on Twitter by operating fake accounts.** This includes using misleading account 

information to engage in spamming, abusive, or disruptive behavior. Some of the factors that we take into 

consideration include: 

• 

use of stock or stolen profile photos, particularly those depicting other people; 

• 

use of stolen or copied profile bios; and 

• 

use of intentionally misleading profile information, including profile location. 

**You can’t artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts or by** 

**coordinating with others to violate the Twitter Rules.** This includes: 

• 

overlapping accounts – operating multiple accounts with overlapping use cases, such as identical or 

similar personas or substantially similar content; 

• 

mutually interacting accounts – operating multiple accounts that interact with one another in order to 

inflate or manipulate the prominence of specific Tweets or accounts; and 

• 

coordination – creating multiple accounts to post duplicative content or create fake engagement, 

including: 

o 

posting identical or substantially similar Tweets or hashtags from multiple accounts you 

operate; 

o 

engaging (Retweets, Likes, mentions, Twitter Poll votes) repeatedly with the same Tweets or 

accounts from multiple accounts that you operate; 

o 

coordinating with or compensating others to engage in artificial engagement or amplification, 

even if the people involved use only one account; and 

o 

coordinating with others to engage in or promote violations of the Twitter Rules, including 

violations of our abusive behavior policy. 

**Engagement and metrics** 

**You can’t artificially inflate your own or others’ followers or engagement.** This includes: 

• 

selling/purchasing Tweet or account metric inflation – selling or purchasing followers or engagements 

(Retweets, Likes, mentions, Twitter Poll votes); 

• 

apps – using or promoting third-party services or apps that claim to add followers or add engagements 

to Tweets; 

• 

reciprocal inflation – trading or coordinating to exchange follows or Tweet engagements (including but 

not limited to participation in “follow trains,” “decks,” and “Retweet for Retweet” behavior); and 

• 

account transfers or sales – selling, purchasing, trading, or offering the sale, purchase, or trade of Twitter 

accounts, usernames, or temporary access to Twitter accounts. 

**Misuse of Twitter product features** 

**You can’t misuse Twitter product features to disrupt others’ experience.** This includes: 

**Tweets and Direct Messages** 

• 

sending bulk, aggressive, high-volume unsolicited replies, mentions, or Direct Messages; 

• 

posting and deleting the same content repeatedly; 

• 

repeatedly posting identical or nearly identical Tweets, or repeatedly sending identical Direct Messages; 

and 

• 

repeatedly posting Tweets or sending Direct Messages consisting of links shared without commentary, 

so that this comprises the bulk of your Tweet/Direct Message activity. 

**Following** 

• 

“follow churn” – following and then unfollowing large numbers of accounts in an effort to inflate one’s 

own follower count; 

• 

indiscriminate following – following and/or unfollowing a large number of unrelated accounts in a short 

time period, particularly by automated means; and 

• 

duplicating another account’s followers, particularly using automation. 

**Engagement** 

• 

aggressively or automatically engaging with Tweets to drive traffic or attention to accounts, websites, 

products, services, or initiatives. 

• 

aggressively adding users to Lists or Moments. 

**Hashtags** 

• 

using a trending or popular hashtag with an intent to subvert or manipulate a conversation or to drive 

traffic or attention to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives; and 

• 

Tweeting with excessive, unrelated hashtags in a single Tweet or across multiple Tweets. 

**URLs** 

• 

publishing or linking to malicious content intended to damage or disrupt another person’s browser 

(malware) or computer or to compromise a person’s privacy (phishing); and 

• 

posting misleading or deceptive links; e.g., affiliate links and clickjacking links. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

The following are not in violation of this policy: 

• 

using Twitter pseudonymously or as a parody, commentary, or fan account; 

• 

posting links without commentary occasionally; 

• 

coordinating with others to express ideas, viewpoints, support, or opposition towards a cause, provided 

such behavior does not result in violations of the Twitter Rules; and 

• 

operating multiple accounts with distinct identities, purposes, or use cases. These accounts may interact 

with one another, provided they don’t violate other rules. Some examples include: 

o 

organizations with related but separate chapters or branches, such as a business with multiple 

locations; 

o 

operating a personal account in addition to pseudonymous accounts or accounts associated 

with your hobbies or initiatives; and 

o 

hobby/artistic bots. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?**

number of actions ranging from requiring deletion of one of more Tweets to temporarily locking 

account(s). Any subsequent platform manipulation offenses will result in permanent suspension. 

• 

In the case of a violation centering around the use of multiple accounts, you may be asked to choose one 

account to keep. The remaining accounts will be permanently suspended. 

• 

If we believe you may be in violation of our fake accounts policy, we may require you provide 

government-issued identification (such as a driver’s license or passport) in order to reinstate your 

account. 

**Permanent suspension** 

For severe violations, accounts will be permanently suspended at first detection. Examples of severe violations 

include: 

• 

operating accounts where the majority of behavior is in violation of the policies described above;

**Civic integrity policy**(20201028*)

**Overview** 

**October 2020** 

**You may not use Twitter’s services for the purpose of** **manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic** 

**processes. This includes posting or sharing content that may suppress participation or mislead people** 

**about when, where, or how to participate in a civic process. In addition, we may label and reduce the** 

**visibility of Tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes in order to provide** 

**additional context.** 

The public conversation occurring on Twitter is never more important than during elections and other civic events. 

Any attempts to undermine the integrity of our service is antithetical to our fundamental rights and undermines 

the core tenets of freedom of expression, the value upon which our company is based. 

We believe we have a responsibility to protect the integrity of those conversations from interference and 

manipulation. Therefore, we prohibit attempts to use our services to manipulate or disrupt civic processes, 

including through the distribution of false or misleading information about the procedures or circumstances 

around participation in a civic process. In instances where misleading information does not seek to directly 

manipulate or disrupt civic processes, but leads to confusion on our service, we may label the Tweets to give 

additional context. 

**What is a civic process?** 

Twitter considers civic processes to be events or procedures mandated, organized, and conducted by the 

governing and/or electoral body of a country, state, region, district, or municipality to address a matter of 

common concern through public participation. Some examples of civic processes may include: 

• 

Political elections 

• 

Censuses 

• 

Major referenda and ballot initiatives 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

This policy addresses 4 categories of misleading behavior and content: 

**Misleading information about how to participate** 

We will label or remove false or misleading information about how to participate in an election or other civic 

process. This includes but is not limited to: 

• 

misleading information about procedures to participate in a civic process (for example, that you can vote 

by Tweet, text message, email, or phone call in jurisdictions where these are not a possibility); 

• 

misleading information about requirements for participation, including identification or citizenship 

requirements; 

• 

misleading claims that cause confusion about the established laws, regulations, procedures, and methods 

of a civic process, or about the actions of officials or entities executing those civic processes; and 

• 

misleading statements or information about the official, announced date or time of a civic process. 

**Suppression and intimidation** 

We will label or remove false or misleading information intended to intimidate or dissuade people from 

participating in an election or other civic process. This includes but is not limited to: 

• 

misleading claims that polling places are closed, that polling has ended, or other misleading information 

relating to votes not being counted; 

• 

misleading claims about police or law enforcement activity related to voting in an election, polling 

places, or collecting census information; 

• 

misleading claims about long lines, equipment problems, or other disruptions at voting locations during 

election periods; 

• 

misleading claims about process procedures or techniques which could dissuade people from 

participating; and 

• 

threats regarding voting locations or other key places or events (note that our violent threats policy may 

also be relevant for threats not covered by this policy). 

**Misleading information about outcomes**  

We will label or remove false or misleading information intended to undermine public confidence in an election or 

other civic process. This includes but is not limited to: 

• 

disputed claims that could undermine faith in the process itself, such as unverified information about 

election rigging, ballot tampering, vote tallying, or certification of election results; and 

• 

misleading claims about the results or outcome of a civic process which calls for or could lead to 

interference with the implementation of the results of the process, e.g. claiming victory before election 

results have been certified, inciting unlawful conduct to prevent the procedural or practical 

implementation of election results (note that our violent threats policy may also be relevant for threats 

not covered by this policy). 

**False or misleading affiliation** 

You can’t create fake accounts which misrepresent their affiliation, or share content that falsely represents its 

affiliation, to a candidate, elected official, political party, electoral authority, or government entity. Read more 

about our parody, commentary, and fan account policy. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

Not all false or untrue information about politics or civic processes constitutes manipulation or interference. In the 

absence of other policy violations, the following are generally not in violation of this policy: 

• 

inaccurate statements about an elected or appointed official, candidate, or political party; 

• 

organic content that is polarizing, biased, hyperpartisan, or contains controversial viewpoints expressed 

about elections or politics; 

• 

discussion of public polling information; 

• 

voting and audience participation for competitions, game shows, or other entertainment purposes; and 

• 

using Twitter pseudonymously or as a parody, commentary, or fan account to discuss elections or 

politics. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Accurate reporting of suspected violations of this policy requires information and knowledge specific to an 

election or civic process. Therefore, we enable reporting of false or misleading information about civic processes 

in advance of major events, for people located in the relevant countries and locations. We also work with select 

government and civil society partners in these countries to provide additional channels for reporting and 

expedited review. 

For civic processes with multiple stages or parts, such as primary elections or lengthy campaigns, reporting will be 

enabled leading up to the first officially-sanctioned event associated with the civic process. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?** 

If the reporting option for this policy is enabled in your country at the relevant time, you can report this content 

in-app or on desktop. 

**In-app** 

You can report this content for review in-app as follows: 

1. 

Select **Report Tweet** from the icon. 

2. 

Select **It&aposs misleading about a political election or other civic event**. 

3. 

Select the option that best tells us how the Tweet is misleading about voting or participation in civic 

processes. 

4. 

Submit your report. 

**Desktop** 

You can report this content for review on desktop as follows: 

1. 

Select **Report Tweet** from the icon. 

2. 

Select **It&aposs misleading about a political election or other civic event**. 

3. 

Select the option that best tells us how the Tweet is misleading about voting or participation in a civic 

process. 

4. 

Submit your report. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

The consequences for violating our civic integrity policy depends on the severity and type of the violation and the 

accounts’ history of previous violations. The actions we take may include the following: 

**Tweet deletion** 

The first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you 

out of your account before you can Tweet again. 

**Profile modifications** 

If you violate this policy within your profile information (e.g., your bio), we will require you to remove this content. 

We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you violate this policy again 

after your first warning, your account will be permanently suspended. 

**Labeling** 

In circumstances where we do not remove content which violates this policy, we may provide additional context 

on Tweets sharing the content where they appear on Twitter. This means we may: 

• 

Apply a label and/or warning message to the content where it appears in the Twitter product; 

• 

Show a warning to people before they share or like the content; 

• 

Reduce the visibility of the content on Twitter and/or prevent it from being recommended; and/or 

• 

Provide a link to additional explanations or clarifications, such as in a Twitter Moment or relevant Twitter 

policies. 

In most cases, we will take all of the above actions on Tweets we label. In some instances, we’ll also turn off your 

ability to reply, Retweet, or like the Tweet. We prioritize producing Twitter Moments in cases where misleading 

content on Twitter is gaining significant attention and has caused public confusion on our service. 

**Permanent suspension** 

For severe or repeated violations of this policy, accounts will be permanently suspended. 

If you believe that your account was locked or suspended in error, you can submit an appeal. 

 

**Impersonation policy** **(20191001*)** 

Impersonation is a violation of the Twitter Rules. Twitter accounts that pose as 

another person, brand, or organization in a confusing or deceptive manner may be 

permanently suspended under Twitter’s impersonation policy. 

**What is not an impersonation policy violation?** 

Accounts with similar usernames or that are similar in appearance (e.g., the same 

profile image) are not automatically in violation of the impersonation policy. In order 

to violate our impersonation policy, the account must portray another entity in a 

misleading or deceptive manner. 

An account will not be removed if: 

• 

The user shares your name but has no other commonalities, or 

• 

The profile clearly states it is not affiliated with or connected to any similarly-named individuals or 

brands. 

Twitter users are allowed to create parody, newsfeed, commentary, or fan accounts. 

Please refer to Twitter’s parody, newsfeed, commentary, and fan account policy for 

more information about these types of accounts. 

**When does Twitter review accounts under this policy?** 

We review impersonation claims upon receipt of a valid impersonation report. We do 

not actively monitor users’ content. 

**How do I file an impersonation report?** 

If you are the impersonated party or an authorized representative, you can file an 

impersonation report. If you believe an account is impersonating somebody else, you 

can flag it as a bystander by reporting directly from the account’s profile. 

Please note, submitting a report with incomplete information will delay the 

processing of your report. 

**Can I request a specific username?** 

We generally do not accept individual requests for inactive or suspended usernames. 

**What if my trademark is being misused?** 

Companies and businesses should report accounts misusing their trademarks by 

filing a complaint under our trademark policy. Please review the trademark policy 

page for more information. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

If we determine that you violated our impersonation policy, we may suspend your 

account. In some instances, an account may be permanently suspended upon first 

review. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an 

appeal.

development and enforcement. 

 

Synthetic and manipulated media policy 

(20210626*) 

Overview 

 

You may not deceptively promote synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to 

cause harm. In addition, we may label Tweets containing synthetic and manipulated 

media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide additional context. 

You should be able to find reliable information on Twitter. That means understanding 

whether the content you see is real or fabricated and having the ability to find more 

context about what you see on Twitter. Therefore, we may label Tweets that include 

media (videos, audio, and images) that have been deceptively altered or fabricated. In 

addition, you may not share deceptively altered media on Twitter in ways that mislead 

or deceive people about the media&aposs authenticity where threats to physical safety or 

other serious harm may result. 

We use the following criteria as we consider Tweets and media for labeling or removal 

under this policy as part of our ongoing work to enforce our rules and ensure healthy 

and safe conversation on Twitter (additional information is available below): 

 

1. Is the content synthetic or manipulated? 

 

In order for content to be labeled or removed under this policy, we must have reason to 

believe that media, or the context in which media are presented, are significantly and 

deceptively altered or manipulated. Synthetic and manipulated media take many 

different forms and people can employ a wide range of technologies to produce these 

media. In assessing whether media have been significantly and deceptively altered or 

fabricated, some of the factors we consider include: 

• whether the content has been substantially edited in a manner that 

fundamentally alters its composition, sequence, timing, or framing; 

• any visual or auditory information (such as new video frames, overdubbed audio, 

or modified subtitles) that has been added or removed; and 

• whether media depicting a real person have been fabricated or simulated 

 

We are most likely to take action (either labeling or removal, as described below) on 

more significant forms of alteration, such as wholly synthetic audio or video or content 

that has been doctored (spliced and reordered, slowed down) to change its meaning. 

Subtler forms of manipulated media, such as isolative editing, omission of context, or 

presentation with false context, may be labeled or removed on a case-by-case basis. 

We will not take action to label or remove media that have been edited in ways that do 

not fundamentally alter their meaning, such as retouched photos or color-corrected 

videos. 

In order to determine if media have been significantly and deceptively altered or 

fabricated, we may use our own technology or receive reports through partnerships 

with third parties. In situations where we are unable to reliably determine if media have 

been altered or fabricated, we may not take action to label or remove them. 

 

2. Is the content shared in a deceptive manner? 

 

We also consider whether the context in which media are shared could result in 

confusion or misunderstanding or suggests a deliberate intent to deceive people about 

the nature or origin of the content, for example by falsely claiming that it depicts 

reality. We assess the context provided alongside media to see whether it makes clear 

that the media have been altered or fabricated. Some of the types of context we assess in 

order to make this determination include: 

• The text of the Tweet accompanying or within media 

• Metadata associated with media 

• Information on the profile of the account sharing media 

• Websites linked in the Tweet, or in the profile of the account sharing media 

 

3. Is the content likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm? 

 

Tweets that share synthetic and manipulated media are subject to removal under this 

policy if they are likely to cause serious harm. Some specific harms we consider include: 

• Threats to the physical safety of a person or group 

• Risk of mass violence or widespread civil unrest 

• Threats to the privacy or ability of a person or group to freely express themselves 

or participate in civic events, such as: 

• 

Stalking or unwanted and obsessive attention 

•

Targeted content that includes tropes, epithets, or material that aims 

to silence someone 

• 

Voter suppression or intimidation 

 

While we have other rules also intended to address these forms of harm, including our 

policies on violent threats, election integrity, and hateful conduct, we will err toward 

removal in borderline cases that might otherwise not violate existing rules for Tweets 

that include synthetic or manipulated media. 

We also consider the time frame within which the content may be likely to impact 

public safety or cause serious harm, and are more likely to remove content under this 

policy if we find that immediate harms are likely to result from the content’s presence 

on Twitter. 

Note: We may also take action on synthetic and manipulated content under our non-

consensual nudity policy (such as pornographic media altered to insert the faces of 

people not actually involved) or other parts of the Twitter Rules.  

Labeling and removal 

 

In most cases, if we have reason to believe that media shared in a Tweet have been 

significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated, we will provide additional context on 

Tweets sharing the media where they appear on Twitter. This means we may: 

• Apply a label to the content where it appears in the Twitter product; 

• Show a warning to people before they share or like the content; 

• Reduce the visibility of the content on Twitter and/or prevent it from being 

recommended; 

• Provide a link to additional explanations or clarifications, such as in a Twitter 

Moment or landing page; and/or 

• Turn off likes, replies, and Retweets. 

 

In most cases, we will take all of the above actions on Tweets we label. 

Media that meet all three of the criteria defined above—i.e. that are synthetic or 

manipulated, shared in a deceptive manner, and is likely to cause harm—may not be 

shared on Twitter and are subject to removal. Accounts engaging in repeated or severe 

violations of this policy may be permanently suspended. 

 

* Other parts of the Twitter Rules apply and may lead to the removal of the content, 

particularly where there is high likelihood of severe harm, such as a threat to someone’s 

life or physical safety. 

 

 

 

 

 

**Trademark policy**(20190607*)

**Overview** 

**March 2019** 

**You may not violate others’ intellectual property rights, including** **copyright and trademark.** 

A trademark is a word, logo, phrase, or device that distinguishes a trademark holder’s good or service in the 

marketplace. Trademark law may prevent others from using a trademark in an unauthorized or confusing 

manner. 

**What is in violation of this policy?** 

Using another’s trademark in a way that may mislead or confuse people about your affiliation may be a violation 

of our trademark policy. 

**What is not a violation of this policy?** 

Referencing another’s trademark is not automatically a violation of Twitter&aposs trademark policy. Examples of non-

violations include: 

• 

using a trademark in a way that is outside the scope of the trademark registration e.g., in a different 

territory, or a different class of goods or services than that identified in the registration; and 

• 

using a trademark in a nominative or other fair use manner. For more information, see our parody, 

newsfeed, commentary, and fan account policy. 

**Who can report violations of this policy?** 

Twitter only investigates requests that are submitted by the trademark holder or their authorized representative 

e.g., a legal representative or other representative for a brand. 

**How can I report violations of this policy?** 

You can submit a trademark report through our trademark report form. Please provide all the information 

requested in the form. If you submit an incomplete report, we’ll need to follow up about the missing information. 

Please note that this will result in a delay in processing your report. 

**Note:** We may provide the account holder with your name and other information included in the copy of the 

report. 

**What happens if you violate this policy?** 

If we determine that you violated our trademark policy, we may suspend your account. Depending on the type of 

violation, we may give you an opportunity to comply with our policies. In other instances, an account may be 

permanently suspended upon first review. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you 

can submit an appeal. 

**What is our policy about trademark issues within ads?**

**Copyright policy** **(20200917*)** 

**What types of copyright complaints does Twitter respond to?** 

Twitter responds to copyright complaints submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). 

Section 512 of the DMCA outlines the statutory requirements necessary for formally reporting copyright 

infringement, as well as providing instructions on how an affected party can appeal a removal by submitting a 

compliant counter-notice. 

Twitter will respond to reports of alleged copyright infringement, such as allegations concerning the unauthorized 

use of a copyrighted image as a profile or header photo, allegations concerning the unauthorized use of a 

copyrighted video or image uploaded through our media hosting services, or Tweets containing links to allegedly 

infringing materials. Note that not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted materials are infringements (see our fair 

use article for more information). 

If you are concerned about the use of your brand or entity’s name, please review Twitter’s trademark policy. If you 

are concerned about a parody, newsfeed, commentary, or fan account, please see the relevant policy here. These 

are generally not copyright issues. 

**Am I a copyright holder? How do I know?** 

If you are unsure whether you hold rights to a particular work, please consult an attorney or another adviser as 

Twitter cannot provide legal advice. There are plenty of resources to learn more about copyright law 

including http://copyright.gov, https://lumendatabase.org/, 

and http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP, to name a few. 

**What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint** 

Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, please consider whether or not the use could be considered fair 

use. 

If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first 

reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user. You can reply to the 

user’s Tweet or send the user a Direct Message and ask for them to remove your copyrighted content without 

having to contact Twitter. 

Prior to submitting a formal complaint with Twitter, please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be 

liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially 

misrepresent that material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in 

fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us. 

Note: In general, the photographer and NOT the subject of a photograph is the actual rights holder of the 

resulting photograph. If you’re unsure whether or not you own the copyrights to a work, or if you’re infringing 

upon someone else’s work, please consult an attorney or another advisor. 

**What information do you need to process a copyright complaint?** 

To submit a notice of claimed copyright infringement, you will need to provide us with the following information: 

1. 

A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the copyright owner or a person 

authorized to act on their behalf; 

2. 

Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (e.g., a link to your original work or 

clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed upon); 

3. 

Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit Twitter to locate 

the material on our website or services; 

4. 

Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address; 

5. 

A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner asserted is not 

authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 

6. 

A statement that the information in the complaint is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are 

authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. 

If you are reporting the content of a Tweet, please give us a direct link to that Tweet. Or please specify if the 

alleged infringement is in the header, avatar, etc. A LINK TO A PROFILE PAGE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR TWITTER TO 

IDENTIFY INFRINGING MATERIALS. 

**How do I file a copyright complaint?** 

You can report alleged copyright infringement by visiting Twitter’s Help Center and filing a copyright complaint. If 

you are logged in to twitter.com, you can visit the Twitter Help Center directly from your Twitter account by 

clicking the ‘Help’ link located in the sidebar. 

Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, 

validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, we will take action on your request 

- which includes forwarding a full copy of your notice (including your name, address, phone and email address) to 

the user(s) who posted the allegedly infringing material in question. 

If you are concerned about your contact information being forwarded, you may wish to use an agent to report for 

you. 

Please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ 

fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing. If 

you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney 

before filing a copyright complaint. 

**How are claims processed?** 

We process copyright complaints in the order in which they are received. Once you&aposve submitted your ticket, we 

will email you a ticket confirmation. If you do not receive a ticket confirmation that means we did not receive your 

complaint and you should re-submit your complaint. However, please note, submitting duplicate copyright 

complaints will result in a delay in processing. 

If we decide to remove or disable access to the material, we will notify the affected user(s) and provide them with 

a full copy of the reporter’s complaint (including the provided contact information) along with instructions on how 

to file a counter-notice. We will also forward a redacted copy of the complaint to Lumen, with your personal 

information removed. 

**What information gets forwarded to the reported user(s)?** 

If we remove or disable access to the materials reported in a copyright complaint, the reported user(s) will receive 

a copy of the complaint, including the reporter’s full name, email, street address, and any other information 

included in the complaint. 

If you are uncomfortable sharing your contact information with the reported user(s), you may wish to consider 

appointing an agent to submit your DMCA notice on your behalf. Your agent will be required to submit the DMCA 

notice with valid contact information, and identify you as the content owner that they are representing. 

**What happens next?** 

Twitter’s response to copyright complaints may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing 

material. If we remove or restrict access to user content in response to a copyright complaint, Twitter will make a 

good faith effort to contact the affected account holder with information concerning the removal or restriction of 

access, including a full copy of the complaint, along with instructions for filing a counter-notice. 

If you’ve not yet received a copy of the copyright complaint regarding the content removed from your account, 

please respond to the support ticket we sent you. If your complaint involves removal of content from Periscope, 

please see this help center article regarding how to request a copy of your complaint. 

In an effort to be as transparent as possible regarding the removal or restriction of access to user-posted content, 

we clearly mark withheld Tweets and media to indicate to viewers when content has been withheld (examples 

below). We also send a redacted copy of each copyright complaint and counter-notice that we process to Lumen, 

where they are posted to a public-facing website (with your personal information removed). 

 

 

**My content was removed from Twitter** 

*Why did I receive a copyright complaint?* 

If you receive a copyright complaint, it means that access to the content described in the complaint has been 

restricted. Please take the time to read through our correspondence to you, which includes information on the 

complaint we received as well as instructions on how to file a counter-notice. Please ensure that you are 

monitoring the email address associated with your Twitter account. 

Tip: Removing the material reported in a copyright complaint will not resolve that complaint. 

*What if I want to contest the takedown?* 

If you believe that the materials reported in the copyright complaints 

were misidentified or removed in error, you may send us a counter-notification(s). A counter-notice is a request 

for Twitter to reinstate the removed material, and it has legal consequences. Alternatively, you may be able to 

seek a retraction of the copyright complaint from the reporter. 

*How do I seek a retraction?* 

The DMCA complaint you received includes the contact information of the reporter. You may want to reach out 

and ask them to retract their notice. The reporter can send retractions to copyright@twitter.com, and should 

include: (1) identification of the material that was disabled, and (2) a statement that the reporter would like to 

retract their DMCA notice. This is the fastest and most efficient means of resolving an unresolved copyright 

complaint. A retraction is at the sole discretion of the original reporter. 

*When should I file a counter-notice?* 

A counter-notice is a request for Twitter to reinstate the removed material, and is the start of a legal process that 

has legal consequences. For example, submitting a counter notice indicates that you consent to the jurisdiction of 

a U.S. Federal court and that you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to the reporter and 

Lumen website. 

With these considerations in mind, you may file a counter-notice if you believe that this material was 

misidentified, or you have a good faith belief that the material should not have been removed. If you’re unsure 

whether or not you should file a counter-notice, you may want to consult with an attorney. 

Tip: Re-posting material removed in response to a copyright complaint may result in permanent account 

suspension. If you believe the content was removed in error, please file a counter-notice rather than re-posting 

the material. 

*What information do you need to process a counter-notice?* 

To submit a counter-notice, you will need to provide us with the following information: 

1. 

A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice); 

2. 

Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the 

location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (the 

description from the copyright notice will suffice); 

3. 

A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or 

disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and 

4. 

Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the 

Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside 

of the United States, for any judicial district in which Twitter may be found, and that you will accept 

service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of 

such person. 

To submit a counter-notice, please respond to our original email notification of the removal and include the 

required information in the body of your reply as we discard all attachments for security reasons. 

*What happens after I submit a counter-notice?* 

Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice, we will promptly forward a copy to the person who filed the original 

notice. This means that the contact information that is submitted in your counter-notice will be shared to the 

person who filed the original notice. 

If the copyright owner disagrees that the content was removed in error or misidentification, they may pursue legal 

action against you. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the original reporter is seeking a court 

order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the 

material that was removed. 

We cannot offer any legal advice. Should you have questions, please consult an attorney. 

*Filing a copyright complaint or counter-notice is serious business!* 

Please think twice before submitting a claim or counter-notice, especially if you are unsure whether you are the 

actual rights holder or authorized to act on a rights holder’s behalf. There are legal and financial consequences for 

fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Please be sure that you are the actual rights holder, or that you have a 

good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and that you understand the repercussions of submitting 

a false claim. 

*What happens if my account receives multiple copyright complaints?* 

If multiple copyright complaints are received Twitter may lock accounts or take other actions to warn repeat 

violators. These warnings may vary across Twitter’s services. Under appropriate circumstances we may suspend 

user accounts under our repeat infringer policy. However, we may take retractions and counter-notices into 

account when applying our repeat infringer policy. 

 

**Our approach to policy development** 

**and enforcement philosophy**

**(20190520*)**

Twitter is reflective of real conversations happening in the world and that sometimes includes perspectives that 

may be offensive, controversial, and/or bigoted to others. While we welcome everyone to express themselves on 

our service, we will not tolerate behavior that harasses, threatens, or uses fear to silence the voices of others. 

We have the Twitter Rules in place to help ensure everyone feels safe expressing their beliefs and we strive to 

enforce them with uniform consistency. Learn more about different enforcement actions. 

**Our policy development process** 

Creating a new policy or making a policy change requires in-depth research around trends in online behavior, 

developing clear external language that sets expectations around what’s allowed, and creating enforcement 

guidance for reviewers that can be scaled across millions of Tweets. 

While drafting policy language, we gather feedback from a variety of internal teams as well as our Trust & Safety 

Council. This is vital to ensure we are considering global perspectives around the changing nature of online 

speech, including how our rules are applied and interpreted in different cultural and social contexts. Finally, we 

train our global review teams, update the Twitter Rules, and start enforcing the new policy. 

**Our enforcement philosophy** 

We empower people to understand different sides of an issue and encourage dissenting opinions and viewpoints 

to be discussed openly. This approach allows many forms of speech to exist on our platform and, in particular, 

promotes counterspeech: speech that presents facts to correct misstatements or misperceptions, points out 

hypocrisy or contradictions, warns of offline or online consequences, denounces hateful or dangerous speech, or 

helps change minds and disarm. 

Thus, **context matters**. When determining whether to take enforcement action, we may consider a number of 

factors, including (but not limited to) whether: 

• 

the behavior is directed at an individual, group, or protected category of people; 

• 

the report has been filed by the target of the abuse or a bystander; 

• 

the user has a history of violating our policies; 

• 

the severity of the violation; 

• 

the content may be a topic of legitimate public interest. 

**Is the behavior directed at an individual or group of people?** 

To strike a balance between allowing different opinions to be expressed on the platform, and protecting our users, 

we enforce policies when someone reports abusive behavior that targets a specific person or group of people. 

This targeting can happen in a number of ways (for example, @mentions, tagging a photo, mentioning them by 

name, and more). 

**Has the report been filed by the target of the potential abuse or a bystander?** 

Some Tweets may seem to be abusive when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a 

larger conversation or historical relationship between people on the platform. For example, friendly banter 

between friends could appear offensive to bystanders, and certain remarks that are acceptable in one culture or 

country may not be acceptable in another. To help prevent our teams from making a mistake and removing 

consensual interactions, in certain scenarios we require a report from the actual target (or their authorized 

representative) prior to taking any enforcement action. 

**Does the user have a history of violating our policies?** 

We start from a position of assuming that people do not intend to violate our Rules. Unless a violation is so 

egregious that we must immediately suspend an account, we first try to educate people about our Rules and give 

them a chance to correct their behavior. We show the violator the offending Tweet(s), explain which Rule was 

broken, and require them to remove the content before they can Tweet again. If someone repeatedly violates our 

Rules then our enforcement actions become stronger. This includes requiring violators to remove the Tweet(s) and 

taking additional actions like verifying account ownership and/or temporarily limiting their ability to Tweet for a 

set period of time. If someone continues to violate Rules beyond that point then their account may be 

permanently suspended. 

**What is the severity of the violation?** 

Certain types of behavior may pose serious safety and security risks and/or result in physical, emotional, and 

financial hardship for the people involved. These egregious violations of the Twitter Rules — such as posting 

violent threats, non-consensual intimate media, or content that sexually exploits children — result in the 

immediate and permanent suspension of an account. Other violations could lead to a range of different steps, like 

requiring someone to remove the offending Tweet(s) and/or temporarily limiting their ability to post new 

Tweet(s). 

**Is the behavior newsworthy and in the legitimate public interest?** 

Twitter moves at the speed of public consciousness and people come to the service to stay informed about what 

matters. Exposure to different viewpoints can help people learn from one another, become more tolerant, and 

make decisions about the type of society we want to live in. 

To help ensure people have an opportunity to see every side of an issue, there may be the rare occasion when we 

allow controversial content or behavior which may otherwise violate our Rules to remain on our service because 

we believe there is a legitimate public interest in its availability. Each situation is evaluated on a case by case basis 

and ultimately decided upon by a cross-functional team. 

Some of the factors that help inform our decision-making about content are the impact it may have on the public, 

the source of the content, and the availability of alternative coverage of an event. 

Public impact of the content: A topic of legitimate public interest is different from a topic in which the public may 

be curious. We will consider what the impact is to citizens if they do **not** know about this content. If the Tweet 

does have the potential to impact the lives of large numbers of people, the running of a country, and/or it speaks 

to an important societal issue then we may allow the the content to remain on the service. Likewise, if the impact 

on the public is minimal we will most likely remove content in violation of our policies. 

Source of the content: Some people, groups, organizations and the content they post on Twitter may be 

considered a topic of legitimate public interest by virtue of their being in the public consciousness. This does not 

mean that their Tweets will always remain on the service. Rather, we will consider if there is a legitimate public 

interest for a particular Tweet to remain up so it can be openly discussed. 

Availability of coverage: Everyday people play a crucial role in providing firsthand accounts of what’s happening in 

the world, counterpoints to establishment views, and, in some cases, exposing the abuse of power by someone in 

a position of authority. As a situation unfolds, removing access to certain information could inadvertently hide 

context and/or prevent people from seeing every side of the issue. Thus, before actioning a potentially violating 

Tweet, we will take into account the role it plays in showing the larger story and whether that content can be 

found elsewhere.
