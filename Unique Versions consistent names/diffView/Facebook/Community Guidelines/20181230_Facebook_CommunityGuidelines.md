9. Bullying 
II. Safety 
Policy Rationale 
Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making 
statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to 
threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the 
members of our community to feel safe and respected. 
We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention 
of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful 
to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they 
are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we 
require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before 
removing it. 
Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow 
discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the 
news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless 
must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about 
public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. 
Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking 
support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step 
guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, 
parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who 
have students involved with bullying.

10. Harassment 
II. Safety 
Policy Rationale 
We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage 
and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and 
private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the 
platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts 
if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to 
harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage 
people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. 
Do not: 
Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to 
prevent that contact 
Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation

12. Hate Speech 
III. Objectionable Content 
Policy Rationale 
We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected 
characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste sexual 
orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disability or disease. We also 
provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or 
dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion or 
segregation. Attacks are separated into three tiers of severity, described below. 
Do not post: 
Tier 1 attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-
listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those 
described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is

defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed 
characteristics. 
13. Violent and Graphic Content 
III. Objectionable Content 
Policy Rationale 
We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of 
others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We 
allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about 
issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human 
rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different 
sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a 
warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to 
people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or 
violent nature before they click to see it.

captions by the poster that contain

pleasure

15. Sexual Solicitation 
III. Objectionable Content 
Policy Rationale 
As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), 
people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and 
exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. 
We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates 
sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that 
may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may 
be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to 
connect with their friends and the broader community. 
Do not post: 
Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities including but not 
limited to: 
Filmed sexual activities 
Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances

including but not limited to the following:

with at least one of the following elements, none of which violate our Community

Using sexual hints such as mentioning sexual roles, sex positions, fetish 
scenarios, sexual preference/sexual partner preference, state of arousal, act

buttocks, state of hygiene of genitalia or buttocks

19. False news 
IV. Integrity and Authenticity 
Policy rationale 
Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take 
seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want 
to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is 
also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we 
don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its 
distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to 
reduce the spread of false news here. 
We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false 
news in a number of different ways, namely by 
Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that 
propagate misinformation 
Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a 
machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false 
Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party 
fact-checkers 
Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by 
informing them with more context and promoting news literacy 
Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this 
challenging issue 
20. Memorialization 
IV. Integrity and Authenticity 
When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by 
adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear 
that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and 
fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile 
or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still 
alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look 
after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they 
want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when 
the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we 
delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more 
information about our memorialization policy and process.
