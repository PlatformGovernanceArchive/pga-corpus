Community Standards 
Our mission is to give people the power to share and make the 
world more open and connected. Every day, people come to 
Facebook to share their stories, see the world through the eyes of 
others and connect with friends and causes. The conversations that 
happen on Facebook reflect the diversity of a community of more 
than one billion people. 
We want people to feel safe when using Facebook. For that reason, 
we've developed a set of Community Standards, outlined below. 
These policies will help you understand what type of sharing is 
allowed on Facebook, and what type of content may be reported to 
us and removed. Because of the diversity of our global community, 
please keep in mind that something that may be disagreeable or 
disturbing to you may not violate our Community Standards.

Read a letter from our team 
Hello! We lead the teams that create Facebook's content policies 
and provide support to the community. Our teams work to make 
Facebook an open and safe environment for people around the 
world. We’d like to share a few insights into what it’s like serving a 
community of more than a billion people around the world. 
When we share information and opinions with our friends, families, 
communities, and the world around us, that's when we achieve 
extraordinary things - new ideas, opportunities, friendships, and 
collaborations. Every day, people around the world share billions of 
things on Facebook that add value to our lives. But sometimes 
people share content that can be abusive or harmful to the rest of 
the community. 
That’s why we created Community Standards – to explain what 
kinds of things shouldn't be shared on Facebook. Our Community 
Standards aim to find the right balance between giving people a 
place to express themselves and promoting a welcoming and safe 
environment for everyone. 
As you can imagine, striking the right balance is a tough job that we 
approach by focusing on a few key principles: 
• Keeping you safe. We have zero tolerance for any behavior 
that puts people in danger, whether someone is organizing or 
advocating real-world violence or bullying other people. 
Requiring people to use their authentic identity on Facebook 
helps motivate all of us to act responsibly, since our names 
and reputations are visibly linked to our words and actions. 
• Encouraging respectful behavior. We ask people to consider 
their audience when sharing something that may offend 
others. We make it easy for everyone to decide who can see 
the content they share, and we have policies that prohibit 
sexually explicit, hateful, and violent content. 
• Acknowledging cultural diversity. To ensure our policies 
reflect the diversity of our community, we constantly seek and 
review input from experts around the world, as well as our 
community. Those insights help us understand the context 
through which people are sharing, and viewing, content on 
Facebook. 
• Empowering you with tools to control what you see on 
Facebook. Facebook is a place for you to connect with the 
people and things you care about, so we give you tools to 
control what you see, report things to us, and reach out to 
people who post things that you don't like or disagree with. 
Our goal is to create an environment where we don’t need a lot of 
rules, and people on Facebook feel motivated and empowered to 
treat each other with empathy and respect. 
Thank you, 
Monika Bickert

We remove content, disable accounts, and work with law 
enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical 
harm or direct threats to public safety. Learn more about how 
Facebook handles abusive content. 
Direct Threats: How we help people who feel threatened by 
others on Facebook. 
We carefully review reports of threatening language to identify 
serious threats of harm to public and personal safety. We remove 
credible threats of physical harm to individuals. We also remove 
specific threats of theft, vandalism, or other financial harm. 
We may consider things like a person's physical location or public 
visibility in determining whether a threat is credible. We may 
assume credibility of any threats to people living in violent and 
unstable regions. 
Self-Injury: How we work to help prevent self-injury and 
suicide. 
We don’t allow the promotion of self-injury or suicide. We work 
with organizations around the world to provide assistance for 
people in distress. We prohibit content that promotes or 
encourages suicide or any other type of self-injury, including self-
mutilation and eating disorders. We don't consider body 
modification to be self-injury. We also remove any content that 
identifies victims or survivors of self-injury or suicide and targets 
them for attack, either seriously or humorously. People can, 
however, share information about self-injury and suicide that does 
not promote these things. 
Dangerous Organizations: What types of organizations we 
prohibit on Facebook. 
We don’t allow any organizations that are engaged in the following 
to have a presence on Facebook: 
• Terrorist activity, or 
• Organized criminal activity. 
We also remove content that expresses support for groups that are 
involved in the violent or criminal behavior mentioned above. 
Supporting or praising leaders of those same organizations, or 
condoning their violent activities, is not allowed. 
We welcome broad discussion and social commentary on these 
general subjects, but ask that people show sensitivity towards 
victims of violence and discrimination. 
Bullying and Harassment: How we respond to bullying and 
harassment. 
We don’t tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow you to speak 
freely on matters and people of public interest, but remove content 
that appears to purposefully target private individuals with the 
intention of degrading or shaming them. This content includes, but 
is not limited to: 
• Pages that identify and shame private individuals, 
• Images altered to degrade private individuals, 
• Photos or videos of physical bullying posted to shame the 
victim, 
• Sharing personal information to blackmail or harass people, 
and 
• Repeatedly targeting other people with unwanted friend 
requests or messages. 
We define private individuals as people who have neither gained 
news attention nor the interest of the public, by way of their actions 
or public profession. 
Attacks on Public Figures: What protection public figures 
receive on Facebook. 
We permit open and critical discussion of people who are featured 
in the news or have a large public audience based on their 
profession or chosen activities. We remove credible threats to 
public figures, as well as hate speech directed at them – just as we 
do for private individuals. 
Criminal Activity: How we handle reports of criminal activity on 
Facebook. 
We prohibit the use of Facebook to facilitate or organize criminal 
activity that causes physical harm to people, businesses or animals, 
or financial damage to people or businesses. We work with law 
enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical 
harm or direct threats to public safety. 
We also prohibit you from celebrating any crimes you’ve 
committed. We do, however, allow people to debate or advocate 
for the legality of criminal activities, as well as address them in a 
humorous or satirical way. 
Sexual Violence and Exploitation: How we fight sexual violence 
and exploitation on Facebook. 
We remove content that threatens or promotes sexual violence or 
exploitation. This includes the sexual exploitation of minors, and 
sexual assault. To protect victims and survivors, we also remove 
photographs or videos depicting incidents of sexual violence and 
images shared in revenge or without permissions from the people 
in the images. 
Our definition of sexual exploitation includes solicitation of sexual 
material, any sexual content involving minors, threats to share 
intimate images, and offers of sexual services. Where appropriate, 
we refer this content to law enforcement. Offers of sexual services 
include prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed 
sexual activity. 
Regulated Goods 
We prohibit any attempts by unauthorized dealers to purchase, sell, 
or trade prescription drugs and marijuana. If you post an offer to 
purchase or sell firearms, alcohol, tobacco, or adult products, we 
expect you to comply with all applicable laws and carefully consider 
the audience for that content. We do not allow you to use 
Facebook's payment tools to sell or purchase regulated goods on 
our platform.

Encouraging respectful behavior

Overview

Nudity 
• 
Hate Speech 
• 
Violence and Graphic Content 
People use Facebook to share their experiences and to raise 
awareness about issues that are important to them. This means that 
you may encounter opinions that are different from yours, which we 
believe can lead to important conversations about difficult topics. 
To help balance the needs, safety, and interests of a diverse 
community, however, we may remove certain kinds of sensitive 
content or limit the audience that sees it. Learn more about how we 
do that here. 
Nudity 
People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like 
awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of 
nudity because some audiences within our global community may 
be sensitive to this type of content - particularly because of their 
cultural background or age. In order to treat people fairly and 
respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have policies in 
place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when 
reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be more 
blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate 
purposes. We are always working to get better at evaluating this 
content and enforcing our standards. 
We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing 
in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of 
female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow 
photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing 
breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs 
of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. 
Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also 
apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for 
educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. Explicit images of 
sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of sexual acts that go 
into vivid detail may also be removed. 
Hate Speech 
Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly 
attacks people based on their: 
• Race, 
• Ethnicity, 
• National origin, 
• Religious affiliation, 
• Sexual orientation, 
• Sex, gender, or gender identity, or 
• Serious disabilities or diseases. 
Organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against 
these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook. As 
with all of our standards, we rely on our community to report this 
content to us. 
People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and 
practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater 
understanding. Sometimes people share content containing 
someone else's hate speech for the purpose of raising awareness or 
educating others about that hate speech. When this is the case, we 
expect people to clearly indicate their purpose, which helps us 
better understand why they shared that content. 
We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these 
topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, 
they are more responsible when they share this kind of 
commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate 
their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, 
even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we 
urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this 
type of content. 
While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools 
to avoid distasteful or offensive content. Learn more about the tools 
we offer to control what you see. You can also use Facebook to 
speak up and educate the community around you. Counter-speech 
in the form of accurate information and alternative viewpoints can 
help create a safer and more respectful environment. 
Violence and Graphic Content 
Facebook has long been a place where people share their 
experiences and raise awareness about important issues. 
Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and 
graphic images of public interest or concern, such as human rights 
abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share 
this type of content, they are condemning it or raising awareness 
about it. We remove graphic images when they are shared for 
sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. 
When people share anything on Facebook, we expect that they will 
share it responsibly, including carefully choosing who will see that 
content. We also ask that people warn their audience about what 
they are about to see if it includes graphic violence.

Keeping your account and personal 
information secure

Using Your Authentic Identity 
• 
Fraud and Spam 
• 
Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away 
We work hard to help keep your account secure and protect your 
personal information. By joining Facebook, you agree to use your 
authentic name and identity. You may not publish the personal 
information of others without their consent. Learn more about how 
we work to keep your information safe. 
Using Your Authentic Identity: How Facebook’s real name 
requirement creates a safer environment. 
People connect on Facebook using their authentic identities. When 
people stand behind their opinions and actions with their authentic 
name and reputation, our community is more accountable. If we 
discover that you have multiple personal profiles, we may ask you 
to close the additional profiles. We also remove any profiles that 
impersonate other people. 
If you want to create a presence on Facebook for your pet, 
organization, favorite movie, games character, or another purpose, 
please create a Page instead of a Facebook Profile. Pages can help 
you conduct business, reach out to fans, or promote a cause you 
care about. 
Fraud and Spam: How we protect you from fraud and spam. 
We work hard to help ensure that the information you share is 
secure. We investigate any suspected breach of security. Any 
attempt to compromise the security of a Profile, including fraud, 
may be referred to law enforcement. Using misleading or inaccurate 
information to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares is not 
allowed. We also ask that you respect people by not contacting 
them for commercial purposes without their consent. 
Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away: How 
you can create a place to remember lost loved ones on 
Facebook. 
Facebook is a place where people come to share their stories and 
reminisce about friends and family who have passed away. Once we 
receive proof of death, we secure and memorialize accounts. We do 
this once we receive sufficient proof of death. Learn more about 
what happens when we memorialize an account. 
Immediate family members can also request that we remove and 
delete a loved one's profile.

Protecting your intellectual property 
Facebook is a place for you to share the things that are important to 
you. You own all of the content and information you post on 
Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your 
privacy and application settings. However, before sharing content 
on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so. We ask 
that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal 
rights. Learn more about intellectual property rights. 
Reporting Abuse 
Reporting Abuse Controlling What You SeeCommunication Tools 
Our global community is growing every day and we strive to welcome people to an environment 
free from abusive content. To do this, we rely on people like you. If you see something on 
Facebook that you believe violates our terms, please report it to us. We have dedicated teams 
working around the world to review things you report to help make sure Facebook remains safe. 
Governments also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not 
violate our Community Standards. If after careful legal review, we find that the content is illegal 
under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory. 
Please keep the following in mind: 
• 
We may take action any time something violates the Community Standards outlined here. 
• 
We may ask Page owners to associate their name and Facebook Profile with a Page that 
contains cruel and insensitive content, even if that content does not violate our policies. 
• 
Reporting something doesn't guarantee that it will be removed because it may not 
violate our policies. 
• 
Our content reviewers will look to you for information about why a post may violate our 
policies. If you report content, please tell us why the content should be removed (e.g., is it 
nudity or hate speech?) so that we can send it to the right person for review. 
• 
Our review decisions may occasionally change after receiving additional context about 
specific posts or after seeing new, violating content appearing on a Page or Facebook 
Profile. 
• 
The number of reports does not impact whether something will be removed. We never 
remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times. 
• 
The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity 
of the violation and the person's history on Facebook. For instance, we may warn 
someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a 
person's ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook. 
Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we 
offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding 
the posts, people, Pages, and applications you don’t want to see – and we encourage you to use 
these controls to better personalize your experience. Learn more. People also often resolve issues 
they have about a piece of content by simply reaching out to the person who posted it. We’ve 
created tools for you to communicate directly with other people when you’re unhappy with 
posts, photos, or other content you see on Facebook.
