Proprietary Rights in Content on Instagram.

Instagram does NOT claim ANY ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds,

musical works, works of authorship, applications, or any other materials (collectively, "Content") that
you post on or through the Instagram Services. By displaying or publishing ("posting") any Content on
or through the Instagram Services, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and
royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly
display, reproduce and translate such Content, including without limitation distributing part or all of
the Site in any media formats through any media channels, except Content not shared publicly
("private") will not be distributed outside the Instagram Services.

Some of the Instagram Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements

and promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on
the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and
extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Instagram

Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, (ii) the posting and use
of your Content on or through the Instagram Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity
rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person, and (iii)
the posting of your Content on the Site does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third
party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of
Content you post on or through the Instagram Services.

The Instagram Services contain Content of Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram Content is

protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and Instagram owns and retains
all rights in the Instagram Content and the Instagram Services. Instagram hereby grants you a limited,
revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the Instagram Content (excluding any
software code) solely for your personal use in connection with viewing the Site and using the
Instagram Services.

The Instagram Services contain Content of Users and other Instagram licensors. Except as provided

within this Agreement, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute,
perform, display, or sell any Content appearing on or through the Instagram Services.

Instagram performs technical functions necessary to offer the Instagram Services, including but not

limited to transcoding and/or reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the Instagram Services.

Although the Site and other Instagram Services are normally available, there will be occasions when

the Site or other Instagram Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for
emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the
control of Instagram. Also, although Instagram will normally only delete Content that violates this
Agreement, Instagram reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice.
Deleted content may be stored by Instagram in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is not
retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your own
backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service. Instagram will not be liable
to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Instagram Services, or the loss of
any Content.
