Burbn Inc. ("Burbn") operates several websites including instagr.am, instagram.com, and burbn.com. It is
Burbn’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Burbn collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
and the date and time of each visitor request. Burbn’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
information is to better understand how Burbn’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Burbn may
release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
usage of its website.
Burbn also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
logged in users and for users leaving comments on Instagram posts. Burbn only discloses logged in user and
commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the
administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Burbn’s websites choose to interact with Burbn in ways that require Burbn to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Burbn gathers depends on the
nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account on http://instagram.com to
provide a username and email address. In each case, Burbn collects such information only insofar as is
necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Burbn. Burbn does not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Burbn may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Burbn may display this information
publicly or provide it to others. However, Burbn does not disclose personally-identifying information other
than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Burbn discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
it on Burbn’s behalf or to provide services available at Burbn’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to
disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
outside of your home country; by using Burbn’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
them. Burbn will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Burbn
discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do
so by law, or when Burbn believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
property or rights of Burbn, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Burbn website
and have supplied your email address, Burbn may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Burbn and our products.
We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep
this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
or to help us support other users. Burbn takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-
identifying information.
