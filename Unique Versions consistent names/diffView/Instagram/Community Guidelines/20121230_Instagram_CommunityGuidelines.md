The Long
The detailed Community Guidelines below have been created in order to help you understand the best practices as a member
of the Instagram community. By utilizing Instagram you are also subject to our Terms of Use.
What to do:

Do share photos that you’ve taken.

Instagram is a great way to share your life through photos, but we have to ask that you don’t share photos of
someone else’s life. Since users own the rights to all photos they have uploaded using our service, we ask that you
respect their copyright ownership. If you want to express your excitement over a beautiful photo, it’s best to double
tap on the image to like it!

Do share photos that are safe for people of all ages.

Remember that our community is a diverse one, and that your photos are visible to people as young as 13 years
old. While we respect the artistic integrity of photos, we have to keep our product and the photos within it in line
with our App Store’s rating for nudity and mature content. In other words, please do not post nudity or mature
content of any kind.

Do treat others as you would like to be treated.

People from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share images on Instagram, which is
great, but it also means that not everyone will agree with what you think or believe. We ask that all users be polite
and respectful in their interactions with other members.

Do have meaningful & genuine interactions.

Self-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. Users often notice when
you have posted the same comment elsewhere or have followed a large number of users to gain followers in
return, so please be sincere with your exchanges on Instagram.

Do have fun!

Instagram is the best way to quickly share beautiful photographs of your life with others, and see the world through
others’ eyes. It’s photo sharing reinvented, so have fun!
What not to do:
It is important to note that overstepping the boundaries outlined below may result in a disabled account, or discontinued
access to Instagram, without warning.

Don’t share photos that aren’t yours.

This includes other people’s photos, and/or things that you have copied or collected from the Internet. Accounts
that solely consist of only this type of content may be disabled at any time.

Don’t share photos that show nudity or mature content.

If you wouldn’t show the photo you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or your parents, you
probably shouldn’t share it on Instagram. The same rule applies to your profile photo. Accounts found sharing
nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to Instagram may be discontinued.

Don’t share photos of illegal content.

If we find you sharing prohibited or illegal content, including photographs of extreme violence or gore, your account
may be disabled and we will take appropriate action, which may include reporting you to the authorities.

Don’t spam.

Instagram is a place where people can share beautiful photos of their lives, and when you engage in self-
promotional behavior of any kind on Instagram it makes users who have shared that moment with you feel sad
inside. This guideline includes repetitive comments, as well as service manipulation in order to self-promote, and
extends to commercial spam comments, such as discount codes or URLs to websites. We ask that you keep your
interactions on Instagram meaningful and genuine.

Don’t be rude.

Instagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives through
photographs. It is not an appropriate place to abuse, attack, harass, or impersonate others. If we receive valid
complaints about your conduct, we’ll send a warning or disable your account. Alternatively, we’d recommend
users block all meanies & trolls to prevent further issues.

Don't promote or glorify self-harm.

While Instagram is a place where people can share their lives with others through photographs, any account found
encouraging or urging users to embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders; or to cut, harm themselves, or
commit suicide will result in a disabled account without warning. We believe that communication regarding these
behaviors in order to create awareness, come together for support and to facilitate recovery is important, but that
Instagram is not the place for active promotion or glorification of self-harm.
Additional things to remember
Instagram is a diverse community, and it is likely that you will come across things that offend you. If you are
offended by a photo that may not violate any of the above guidelines, we’d suggest you navigate away from the
account, or even use our blocking feature. If you are unsure about the content, you can report it utilizing our built-in
reporting functionality in order to bring it to the Instagram Team’s attention.
If you find that one of your images has been uploaded to another user’s profile, try not to panic. It is likely a
misunderstanding and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the image & politely ask that they take
the content down. If that doesn’t work, please file a DMCA report so that we may investigate.
You might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account to your photo-stream in order to draw
attention to the situation or user, but that’s often not the best way to go about resolving the issue. We do not
encourage singling out the user, as it may be classified as harassment, which violates our guidelines.
If you think that there is immediate cause for concern, you can send a report to the Instagram Team. Please
provide all necessary information for us to quickly respond to an issue that urgently needs our attention, this
includes image descriptions & dates, URLs, and valid usernames.
If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing service, as
Instagram may not be the best place for you. We value these guidelines, and believe that they will help keep Instagram a safe
& fun place for everyone.
