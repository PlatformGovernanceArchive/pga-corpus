The Twitter Rules 
We believe that everyone should have the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, 
without barriers. In order to protect the experience and safety of people who use Twitter, there are some 
limitations on the type of content and behavior that we allow. All users must adhere to the policies set 
forth in the Twitter Rules. Failure to do so may result in the temporary locking and/or permanent 
suspension of account(s). 
Please note that we may need to change these rules from time to time and reserve the right to do so. The 
most current version will always be available at twitter.com/rules. 
Content Boundaries and Use of Twitter 
In order to provide the Twitter service and the ability to communicate and stay connected with others, 
there are some limitations on the type of content that can be published with Twitter. 
• Trademark: We reserve the right to reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses or individuals that 
hold legal claim or trademark on those usernames. Accounts using business names and/or logos 
to mislead others may be permanently suspended. 
• Copyright: We will respond to clear and complete notices of alleged copyright infringement. Our 
copyright procedures are set forth in the Terms of Service. 
• Graphic content: You may not use pornographic or excessively violent media in your profile 
image or header image. Twitter may allow some forms of graphic content in Tweets marked 
as sensitive media. When content crosses the line into gratuitous images of death, Twitter may 
ask that you remove the content out of respect for the deceased. 
• Unlawful use: You may not use our service for any unlawful purposes or in furtherance of illegal 
activities. International users agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and 
acceptable content. 
• Misuse of Twitter badges: You may not use badges, such as but not limited to the “promoted” or 
“verified” Twitter badge, unless provided by Twitter. Accounts using these badges as part of 
profile photos, header photos, or in a way that falsely implies affiliation with Twitter, may be 
suspended. 
Abusive Behavior 
We believe in freedom of expression and in speaking truth to power, but that means little as an 
underlying philosophy if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up. In order to ensure that 
people feel safe expressing diverse opinions and beliefs, we do not tolerate behavior that crosses the line 
into abuse, including behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another user’s voice. 
Any accounts and related accounts engaging in the activities specified below may be temporarily locked 
and/or subject to permanent suspension. 
• Violent threats (direct or indirect): You may not make threats of violence or promote violence, 
including threatening or promoting terrorism. 
• Harassment: You may not incite or engage in the targeted abuse or harassment of others. Some of 
the factors that we may consider when evaluating abusive behavior include: 
o if a primary purpose of the reported account is to harass or send abusive messages to 
others; 
o if the reported behavior is one-sided or includes threats; 
o if the reported account is inciting others to harass another account; and 
o if the reported account is sending harassing messages to an account from multiple 
accounts. 
• Hateful conduct: You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other 
people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, 
religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease. We also do not allow accounts whose primary 
purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories. 
• Multiple account abuse: Creating multiple accounts with overlapping uses or in order to evade 
the temporary or permanent suspension of a separate account is not allowed. 
• Private information: You may not publish or post other people's private and confidential 
information, such as credit card numbers, street address, or Social Security/National Identity 
numbers, without their express authorization and permission. In addition, you may not post 
intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent. Read 
more about our private information policy here. 
• Impersonation: You may not impersonate others through the Twitter service in a manner that is 
intended to or does mislead, confuse, or deceive others. Read more about our impersonation 
policy here. 
• Self-harm: You may encounter someone considering suicide or self harm on Twitter. When we 
receive reports that a person is threatening suicide or self harm, we may take a number of steps 
to assist them, such as reaching out to that person expressing our concern and the concern of 
other users on Twitter or providing resources such as contact information for our mental health 
partners. 
Spam 
We strive to protect people on Twitter from technical abuse and spam. Any accounts engaging in the 
activities specified below may be temporarily locked or subject to permanent suspension. 
• Username squatting: You may not engage in username squatting. Accounts that are inactive for 
more than six months may also be removed without further notice. Some of the factors we take 
into consideration when determining what conduct is considered to be username squatting are: 
o the number of accounts created; 
o creating accounts for the purpose of preventing others from using those account names; 
o creating accounts for the purpose of selling those accounts; and 
o using feeds of third-party content to update and maintain accounts under the names of 
those third parties. 
• Invitation spam: You may not use twitter.com's address book contact import to send repeat, mass 
invitations. 
• Selling usernames: You may not buy or sell Twitter usernames. 
• Malware/Phishing: You may not publish or link to malicious content intended to damage or 
disrupt another person’s browser or computer or to compromise a person’s privacy. 
• Spam: You may not use the Twitter service for the purpose of spamming anyone. What 
constitutes “spamming” will evolve as we respond to new tricks and tactics by spammers. Some 
of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be 
spamming are: 
o if you have followed and/or unfollowed large amounts of accounts in a short time 
period, particularly by automated means (aggressive following or follower churn); 
o if you repeatedly follow and unfollow people, whether to build followers or to garner 
more attention for your profile; 
o if your updates consist mainly of links, and not personal updates; 
o if a large number of people are blocking you; 
o if a large number of spam complaints have been filed against you; 
o if you post duplicate content over multiple accounts or multiple duplicate updates on 
one account; 
o if you post multiple unrelated updates to a topic using #, trending or popular topic, or 
promoted trend; 
o if you send large numbers of duplicate replies or mentions; 
o if you send large numbers of unsolicited replies or mentions; 
o if you add a large number of unrelated users to lists; 
o if you repeatedly create false or misleading content; 
o if you are randomly or aggressively following, liking, or Retweeting Tweets; 
o if you repeatedly post other people’s account information as your own (bio, Tweets, 
URL, etc.); 
o if you post misleading links (e.g. affiliate links, links to malware/clickjacking pages, etc.); 
o if you are creating misleading accounts or account interactions; 
o if you are selling or purchasing account interactions (such as selling or purchasing 
followers, Retweets, likes, etc.); and 
o if you are using or promoting third-party services or apps that claim to get you more 
followers (such as follower trains, sites promising "more followers fast", or any other site 
that offers to automatically add followers to your account). 
See our support articles on Following rules and best practices and Automation rules and best practices for 
more detailed information about how the Rules apply to those particular account behaviors. Accounts 
created to replace suspended accounts will be permanently suspended. 
Accounts under investigation may be removed from search for quality. Twitter reserves the right to 
immediately terminate your account without further notice in the event that, in its judgment, you violate 
these Rules or the Terms of Service. 
Trademark policy  
Updated June 30, 2016 
What is a Trademark Policy Violation on Twitter? 
Using another's trademark in a manner that may mislead or confuse others about your brand affiliation may be a 
violation of our trademark policy. 
How Does Twitter Respond to Trademark Reports? 
We review each report and do the following: 
• 
If we determine that there is a violation of our trademark policy, we may suspend the account. In some 
instances, we may give the account holder an opportunity to comply with our policies before suspending 
the account. For more information, see our Parody, commentary, and fan account policy. 
• 
We may also provide the account holder with your name and information included in the copy of the 
report. 
• 
If you would like to report a trademark violation in a Twitter Ad, please visit our Trademark Policy for 
Promoted Ads to learn more. 
Please note that Twitter only investigates requests that are submitted by the trademark holder or by an authorized 
representative of the trademark holder. 
What is not a Trademark Policy Violation? 
Referencing another's trademark is not automatically a violation of Twitter's trademark policy. Examples include: 
• 
Using a trademark in a way that is outside the scope of the trademark registration (e.g. territory, or 
goods and services identified in the registration). 
• 
Nominative and other fair uses of trademarks are protected uses under our trademark policy, so long as 
the account is clearly distinguished from the trademark owner. This includes use by resellers in certain 
regions and accounts engaging in parody, commentary, or news. For more information, see our Parody, 
commentary, and fan account policy. 
How do I Report a Trademark Policy Violation? 
Submit trademark reports through our Trademark Issue support form. Using the appropriate form ensures we 
have all the information necessary to process your report quickly. Please provide all information requested in the 
form. If you submit a report with incomplete information, we will follow up with you to request that information. 
Please note that this will result in a delay in processing your report. 
If you have trouble using the form, try updating your browser or switching to another browser.

What Types of Copyright Complaints Does Twitter Respond To? 
Twitter responds to copyright notifications submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 
(“DMCA”). Section 512 of the DMCA outlines the statutory requirements necessary for formally 
reporting copyright infringement, as well as providing instructions on how an affected party can appeal a 
removal by submitting a compliant counter-notice. 
Twitter will respond to reports of alleged copyright infringement, such as allegations concerning the 
unauthorized use of a copyrighted image as a profile photo, header photo, or background, allegations 
concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted video or image uploaded through our media hosting 
services, or Tweets containing links to allegedly infringing materials. Note that not all unauthorized uses 
of copyrighted materials are infringements (see our Fair Use page for more information). 
Tip: If you are concerned about the use of your brand or entity’s name, please review 
Twitter’s Trademark Policy. If you are concerned about the use of a fictional character, please see 
our Parody, Commentary, and Fan Accounts Policy. These are generally not copyright issues. 
Am I a Copyright Holder? How Do I Know? 
If you are unsure whether you hold rights to a particular work, please consult an attorney or another 
adviser as Twitter cannot provide legal advice. There are plenty of resources to learn more about 
copyright law including http://copyright.gov, https://lumendatabase.org/, 
and http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP, to name a few. 
Tip: In general, the photographer and NOT the subject of a photograph is the actual rights holder of the 
resulting photograph. 
What Information Do You Need To Process a Copyright Complaint? 
To submit a notice of claimed copyright infringement, you will need to provide us with the following 
information: 



A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the copyright 
owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; 



Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (e.g., a link to 
your original work or clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed upon); 



Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit 
Twitter to locate the material on our website or services; 



Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email 
address; 



A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner 
asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 



A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of 
perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. 
Tip: If you are reporting the content of a Tweet, please give us a direct link to that Tweet following these 
instructions: https://support.twitter.com/articles/80586. Or please specify if the alleged infringement is in 
the background, avatar, etc. A LINK TO A PROFILE PAGE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR TWITTER TO 
IDENTIFY INFRINGING MATERIALS. 
How Do I File a Copyright Complaint? 
You can report alleged copyright infringement by visiting Twitter’s Help Center and filing a copyright 
report. If you are logged in to Twitter.com, you can visit the Twitter Help Center directly from your 
Twitter account by clicking the ‘Help’ link located in the sidebar. 
Please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and 
attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or 
activity is infringing, as was the case in Lenz v. Universal and OPG v. Diebold. If you are unsure whether 
the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a 
notification with us. 
How Are Claims Processed? 
We process reports in the order in which they are received. Once you've submitted your ticket, we will 
email you a ticket confirmation. Please note, submitting duplicate copyright notices may result in a delay 
in processing. 
If we decide to remove or disable access to the material, we will notify the affected user(s) after removing 
or disabling access to the material, provide them with access to the reporter’s complaint along with 
instructions on how to file a counter-notice, and forward a copy of the complaint to Lumen. 
What Happens Next? 
Twitter’s response to notices of alleged copyright infringement may include the removal or restriction of 
access to allegedly infringing material. If we remove or restrict access to user content in response to a 
notice of alleged infringement, Twitter will make a good faith effort to contact the affected account 
holder with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, including a copy of the 
takedown notice, along with instructions for filing a counter-notification. 
Tip: If you’ve not yet received a copy of the copyright notification regarding the content removed from 
your account, please respond to the support ticket we sent you. 
In an effort to be as transparent as possible regarding the removal or restriction of access to user-posted 
content, we clearly mark withheld Tweets and media to indicate to viewers when content has been 
withheld (examples below). We also send a copy of each copyright complaint and counter-notice that we 
process to Lumen, where they are posted to a public-facing website (with your personal information 
removed). 
Withheld Tweet: 
Withheld Media: 
Under appropriate circumstances, Twitter may suspend and warn repeat violators, and in more serious 
cases, permanently terminate user accounts. 
What Happens If I Receive a Copyright Notification? 
If you receive a copyright notification, it means that the content described in the notification has been 
removed from Twitter or access to the content on Twitter has been restricted. Please take the time to 
read through our notice to you, which includes information on the notification we received as well as 
instructions on how to file a counter-notice. 
When Should I File a Counter-notice? 
If you believe that the material reported in the copyright notification you received was misidentified or 
removed in error, you should file a counter-notice as per the instructions below. 
Tip: Re-posting material removed in response to a copyright notification may result in permanent 
account suspension. If you believe the content was removed in error, please file a counter-notification 
rather than simply re-posting the material. 
What Information Do You Need to Process a Counter-notice? 
To submit a counter-notice, you will need to provide us with the following information: 



A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice); 



Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled 
and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was 
disabled (the description from the copyright notice will suffice); 



A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material 
was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed 
or disabled; and 



Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the 
jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, 
or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Twitter may be 
found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification 
under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person. 
To submit a counter-notice, please respond to our original email notification of the removal and include 
the required information in the body of your reply as we discard all attachments for security reasons. 
What Happens After I Submit a Counter-notice? 
Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice, we will promptly forward a copy to the person who filed the 
original notice. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the original reporter is seeking a 
court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling 
access to the material that was removed. 
Tip: We cannot offer any legal advice. Should you have questions, please consult an attorney. 
Filing a Copyright Notice or Counter-notice is Serious Business! 
Please think twice before submitting a claim or counter-notice, especially if you are unsure whether you 
are the actual rights holder or authorized to act on a rights holder’s behalf. There are legal and financial 
consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Please be sure that you are the actual rights 
holder, or that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and that you 
understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim. 
Reporting sensitive media 
If you encounter media in Tweets that you believe should be treated as sensitive under Twitter’s media 
policy, please report it using the process described below. 
How do I report media in Tweets? 
Follow these instructions to report media: 



From the Tweet you would like to report, click or tap the More icon (••• on web or 
iOS; 
on Android). 



Select Report. 



Select It displays a sensitive [image/video/media]. 



Next we’ll provide recommendations for additional actions you can take to improve your 
Twitter experience. 
Please remember that if you are seeing something you don’t like, and Twitter hasn’t placed a warning 
label before it, it’s possible that it doesn’t meet our threshold for a warning on the media. 
What happens to sensitive media I report? 
The Twitter team reviews reports of media flagged by users to determine if that media requires a warning 
message in order to comply with Twitter’s media policies. Please remember that by flagging media you 
are bringing it to the attention of the Twitter team. The flagged content will not automatically receive a 
warning message or be removed from the site. 
For information about what you can do if your content is reported as sensitive, visit this article. 
How to control whether you see sensitive media in Tweets: 
You can choose to view media in Tweets that may contain sensitive content without a warning. If you 
are concerned about viewing sensitive content, you should keep your default settings. Your default 
settings will help by providing warnings before seeing content that has been marked as possibly sensitive. 



Log in to Twitter and go to your Account settings. 



Under the Content section, look for Tweet media and check the box next to Do not 
inform me before showing media that may be sensitive. 



Save your settings at the bottom of the page. 
Note: Remember you can also unfollow or block users that are disrupting your Twitter experience. 
How to report content that is illegal or otherwise violates the 
Twitter Rules 
For information outlining other types of violations and how you can report them to us, please see 
this article. 
Private information posted on 
Twitter
Posting another person’s private and confidential information is a violation of the Twitter 
Rules. Some examples of private and confidential information include:  
credit card information 
social security or other national identity numbers 
addresses or locations that are considered and treated as private 
non-public, personal phone numbers 
non-public, personal email addresses 
images or videos that are considered and treated as private under applicable laws intimate 
photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent  
Keep in mind that although you may consider certain information to be private, not all 
postings of such information may be a violation of this policy. We may consider the context 
and nature of the information posted, local privacy laws, and other case-specific facts when 
determining if this policy has been violated. For example, if information was previously 
posted or displayed elsewhere on the Internet prior to being put on Twitter, it may not be a 
violation of this policy.

here. To learn more about protecting your private information on Twitter and other websites, 
click here.  
Impersonation policy 
Impersonation is a violation of the Twitter Rules. Twitter accounts portraying another person in a 
confusing or deceptive manner may be permanently suspended under the Twitter Impersonation 
Policy. 
An account will not be removed if 
• 
the user shares your name but has no other commonalities, or 
• 
the profile clearly states it is not affiliated with or connected to any similarly-named 
individuals. 
Accounts with similar usernames or that are similar in appearance (e.g. the same background or avatar 
image) are not automatically in violation of the impersonation policy. In order to be impersonation, 
the account must also portray another person in a misleading or deceptive manner. 
Twitter users are allowed to create parody, commentary, or fan accounts. Please refer to Twitter's 
Parody Policy for more information about these types of accounts. 
For Frequently Asked Questions about reporting impersonation on Twitter, click here. 
Username squatting policy 
Username squatting is prohibited by The Twitter Rules. 
Please note that if an account has had no updates, no profile image, and there is no intent to mislead, it 
typically means there's no name-squatting or impersonation. Note that we will not release inactive or 
squatted usernames except in cases of trademark infringement. If your report involves trademark 
infringement, please consult those policies for instructions for reporting these accounts. 
Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for usernames are also violations 
and may result in permanent account suspension. 
Following rules and best practices 
To learn more about following, please read "FAQs about following." 
What are the limits? 
We don’t limit the number of followers you can have. However, we do monitor how aggressively users 
follow other users. We try to make sure that none of our limits restrain reasonable usage, and will not 
affect most Twitter users. 
We monitor all accounts for aggressive following and follow churn (repeatedly following and 
unfollowing large numbers of other users). You can read more about these below, but if you don’t follow 
or unfollow hundreds of users in a single day, and you aren’t using automated methods of following users, 
you should be fine. 
Please note that Twitter does not permit any automated or bulk following or unfollowing 
behavior. Please review our Automation rules and best practices for more information on automating 
your account. 
What is aggressive following? 
Aggressive following is defined as indiscriminately following hundreds of accounts just to garner 
attention. However, following a few users if their accounts seem interesting is normal and is not 
considered aggressive. 
What is aggressive follow churn? 
If you decide to follow someone and then change your mind later, you can just visit the person’s profile 
page and unfollow them. Aggressive follow churn is when an account repeatedly follows and then 
unfollows a large number of users. This may be done to get lots of people to notice them, to circumvent a 
Twitter limit, or to change their follower-to-following ratio. These behaviors negatively impact the 
Twitter experience for other users, are common spam tactics, and may lead to account suspension. 
Are there additional limits if you are following 5000+ accounts? 
The rules about aggressive following and follow churn still apply. In addition, every user can follow 5000 
people total. Once you’ve followed 5000 users, there are limits to the number of additional users you can 
follow: this limit is different for every user and is based on your ratio of followers to following. 
When you hit this limit, we’ll tell you by showing an error message in your browser. You’ll need to wait 
until you have more followers in order to follow more users—for example, you can't follow 10,000 
people if only 100 people follow you. When you reach a daily or total limit and we show you an error 
message, you've hit a technical limit imposed to limit egregious behavior by spam accounts and to 
prevent strain on the site. These are just the technical limits for your account; in addition, you are 
prohibited from aggressive following behaviors. These behaviors may result in account suspension, 
regardless of your account's technical ratio. 
Limits improve site performance by ensuring that when we send a person's message to all of their 
followers, the sending of that message is meaningful. Follow limits cannot be lifted by Twitter, and 
everyone is subject to them, including verified and developer accounts. Based on current behavior in the 
Twitter community, we've concluded that this is both fair and reasonable. 
Why does Twitter monitor following behavior at all? Isn’t this a 
social network? 
Twitter works quite differently from social networks: when you accept friend requests on other social 
networks like Facebook, it usually means you appear in that person's network and they appear in yours. 
Following on Twitter is different because following is not mutual. Twitter allows people to opt-in to (or 
opt-out of) receiving a person's updates without requiring a mutual relationship. 
Limits on Twitter alleviate some of the strain on the invisible part of Twitter, which prevents error pages 
and downtime on the visible part. For the sake of reliability, we've placed limits on actions like following, 
API requests per hour, and number of updates per day (see this page for more information on updating 
and API limits). 
Finally, follower violations are one tactic that spammers often use to abuse Twitter. Monitoring for abuse 
is one way to reduce spam on Twitter. 
What are third party applications to “Get More Followers Fast!”? 
You may encounter websites or applications claiming they can help you get lots of followers quickly. 
These programs may ask for payment for followers, or ask you to follow a list of other users in order to 
participate. Using these is not allowed according to the Twitter Rules. 
•  The Twitter Rules addresses the use of these programs by disallowing: using or promoting third-
party sites that claim to get you more followers (such as follower trains, sites promising ‘more 
followers fast,’ or any other site that offers to automatically add followers to your account). 
When you give out your username and password to another site or application, you are giving control of 
your account to someone else. They may then post duplicated, spam, or malicious updates and links, send 
unwanted direct messages, aggressively follow, or violate other Twitter rules with your account. When 
these applications do add followers to your account, they are often abandoned or bot accounts that are 
not reading your updates. If a third-party application causes your account to violate the Twitter Rules, 
your account may be suspended. 
Some third-party applications have been implicated in spam behavior, fraud, the selling of usernames and 
passwords, and phishing. Please do not give your username and password out to any third-party 
application that you have not thoroughly researched. 
Revoke access for any third-party application that you don't recognize by visiting the Applications tab in 
Account Settings. 
Are there following limits if I'm whitelisted? 
Some API administrators have whitelist status so their applications can function without hitting certain 
system limits. Whitelisting means that an application can have more API requests per hour; it does not 
increase the follow limits. All whitelisted accounts are still subject to follow limits. 
So how am I supposed to get followers? 
Remember, Twitter isn’t a race to get the most followers. If you follow users that you’re interested in and 
post meaningful content, it’s more likely that legitimate users will find you and read your updates. People 
follow other users on Twitter to read updates that are interesting to them. Aggressively following and 
unfollowing accounts is frustrating to other Twitter users and degrades the Twitter experience for 
everyone.

Automation Rules & Best Practices
Submitted Nov 08, 2009 by ginger 
We’re constantly amazed by the applications and services that grow up around the Twitter platform. External 
developers have created tools and applications enabling an incredible array of uses; we've seen Twitter accounts 
that help people stay updated on their city’s emergency services, connect to national health alerts, and catch up 
on the happenings of their local bridge. 
Most users will not need to review this document; however, some people are keen on automation. Unfortunately, 
spammers have also taken advantage of automation, to the frustration of genuine users. This page has 
information on what account automations are allowed and which ones could get your account filtered from search 
or even suspended or terminated. 
How Automation Works 
In order for an outside party to post to your account or perform other account actions (like following), you have to 
grant them access by either establishing a Twitter Connection or by giving them your username and password. 
Please see our help page on Connecting to Third-Party Applications for information on the difference, and how to 
revoke access for each method. 
Ultimately, you are responsible for the updates to your timeline and the actions of your account, which means you 
shouldn't give control of your account to a third-party unless you've thoroughly investigated the application. If you 
decide to automate any account actions, you will need to manage your automations carefully to avoid violating 
the Twitter Rules. Violating these rules may result in account suspension or termination, or your account being 
filtered from search, regardless of whether you performed the violation manually, or allowed an automation to do 
so! 
Automating your Tweets 
Automating Your Tweets Based on an Action You've Completed: 
Maybe you want to post to your Twitter timeline whenever you upload a video to YouTube, create a new photo 
album, or beat a high score in your favorite game? Sounds great! It’s generally fine to update your Twitter account 
when you complete a particular action. Just be careful—if you post similar updates too frequently, your followers 
might get a little bored! 
Automating Your Tweets by Streaming External Information: 
If you want to automate your account with a feed from your personal blog or updates from your RSS feed, please 
consider the following: 
• 
Feeds of your own blog: It’s generally fine to automate your account with updates of your own 
content; just be sure to review the Twitter Rules before setting up your automation. 
• 
Feeds that go through redirects or ad pages: If you're posting automated links that redirect through 
landing or ad pages before the final content, your account may be suspended for posting misleading 
links, a violation of the Twitter Rules. 
• 
Feeds for community benefit: We welcome feeds that are used for community benefit or provide 
non-commercial information to a niche group of users, such as local weather feeds or transit 
information. 
Automatically Tweeting to Trending Topics: 
Trending topics are the most tweeted-about topics on Twitter. Posting to current trending topics in an automated 
fashion can degrade the experience for other users, and may result in your account being automatically filtered 
from search. If this happens, your followers will still see your tweets but you won't show in search results. 
Automating your tweets to include references to unrelated trending topics will result in account suspension. 
Mass-creating Automated Accounts: 
There are legitimate reasons why users may have multiple accounts. Serial account creation without prior 
approval, however, is not allowed. Please file a support ticket if you would like permission for creating a series of 
accounts. Include the list of accounts and your planned use of each account; accounts with overlapping use 
cases and names are generally not approved. 
We have allowed multiple, automated accounts for community benefit. For example, Twitter users can now find 
out when the Hubble passes overhead, whether they’re in San Francisco or Hong Kong. If the content is available 
elsewhere on Twitter, however, and does not clearly benefit a community or provide unique information to a niche 
group of users, these accounts may not be allowed. 
Automated Advertising Updates: 
We are continuing to consider the issue of advertising on the Twitter platform. We're committed to encouraging 
and supporting individuals and businesses who want to discuss and promote the products they care about. At the 
same time, we’ve also seen an increase in the number of fully-automated, spam accounts promoting affiliate 
offers. These accounts use automated following, automated @replying, and serial account creation to spam other 
users with mass-created advertising. These behaviors are all prohibited by the Twitter Rules. 
The guidelines in this section are meant to both reduce automated spam on Twitter, and provide guidance for 
users interested in including advertising for others in their timeline. 
Automated or mass-created affiliate advertising is not permitted on Twitter. Updates that are posted 
automatically to your account through a tool or third-party application, for which you are compensated (whether on 
a "per-click," "per-sale," "per-tweet," or other basis), are prohibited. 
We’re still thinking about the full spectrum of advertising on Twitter; in the meantime, other forms of advertising 
and promotion are allowed, but subject to the rules in this document. The following forms of advertising are not 
prohibited: 
• 
Promoting your own business or website. 
• 
Tweeting unpaid consumer recommendations. 
• 
Tweeting sponsored or compensated links and updates that you have manually posted or approved. 
Your tweets may be sponsored by a third-party if you manually post or approve each sponsored tweet before it is 
posted. These updates may not be automated or scheduled in advance. The following rules also apply: 



All sponsored or paid updates must be manually approved. You should either manually post these to 
your account, or individually approve the tweets to be posted to your account. 



You shouldn't repeatedly post the same ad updates. 



If you're using a third-party tool or application to approve and post your tweets, it must be an 
application with Twitter OAuth approval. Please see the FAQ below for more information. 



You should disclose when you post a compensated or sponsored update. 
Users combining advertising with other automations should be particularly careful to review the Twitter 
Rules and Follow Rules and Best Practices. Account suspensions may be appealed by filing a support ticket. 
Finally, please do not attempt to circumvent our guidelines on automated advertising by creating lots of bot 
accounts that promote similar or duplicate websites (or websites with scraped content); these accounts may be 
permanently suspended or terminated. 
Automating other Account Actions 
When you’re automating account behaviors like @replies, DMs, and retweets, we recommend you follow a 
general guideline: be nice to other Twitter users. In general, we take a skeptical view of disingenuous social 
action. If your actions are annoying a bunch of Twitter users, you probably will want to rethink or adjust your 
automation. Here are some more specific guidelines: 
Automated @Replies: 
The @reply function is intended to make communication between users easier, and automating this process to 
put unsolicited messages into lots of users’ reply tabs is considered an abuse of feature. If you are automatically 
sending @reply messages to a bunch of users, the recipients must request or approve this action in advance. For 
example, sending automated @replies based on keyword searches is not permitted. 
Users should also have an easy way to opt-out of your service (in addition to the requirement that all users must 
opt-in before receiving the messages). We review blocks and reports of spam, so you’ll need to provide a clear 
way for users to stop your messages. 
Automated Retweeting of Other Users: 
Retweeting someone means you think your followers should see their tweet. When you’re retweeting in an 
automated fashion, and especially based on an automated search or keyword, this becomes less true. 
We discourage the automatic retweeting of other users based on a particular keyword and may suspend or 
terminate accounts that engage in this behavior, particularly if they are being frequently blocked and reported as 
spam by the users they are retweeting. If you are rewteeting users just so they will see your update in their replies 
folder and look at your account, this is akin to @reply spam and your account may be suspended or terminated. 
Automated Following and Un-Following: 
Twitter users often review the profiles and recent tweets of their new followers. Being followed in a bulk, 
automated fashion can make this process bothersome and makes Twitter a less fun place to hang out. 
The only auto-following behavior Twitter allows is auto-follow-back (following a user after they have followed you). 
Automated un-following is also not permitted. If you find yourself frequently needing to un-follow large numbers of 
users, you might consider reviewing your criteria for following them. Please review our Follow Rules and Best 
Practices for a detailed discussion of following recommendations. 
Also note that in the general Twitter Rules that "get followers fast" applications and services are not allowed. Do 
not surrender your username and password to them. 
Automating Your DMs (Direct Messages): 
Including an automated “thanks for following” message to your new followers might be annoying to some users. 
We do not recommend, but generally do not regulate, this behavior; if you receive a DM you don’t like, you can 
un-follow that user and they will no longer be able to send you messages. 
Automation that Causes Your Account to Violate the Twitter Rules: 
If your account automation is causing your account to violate the Twitter Rules (by retweeting spam updates, 
repeatedly posting duplicate links, etc.), your account may be suspended or terminated. You are responsible for 
the updates on your account, so please do not add automations unless you are confident you will be able to 
manage your account within the rules. 
Other Questions (FAQ) 
What is an application with Twitter OAuth approval? 
As discussed above, you may post manually-approved, compensated tweets through a third-party application with 
Twitter OAuth approval. If an application has OAuth approval, the following will be true 



You allow the application access by approving their connection, not by giving out your username and 
password. 



Once approved, you’ll be able to see and revoke the connection from your connections tab. 
When tweets come from a third-party application, the name of the source is included to the right of the time-
stamp, like this:
