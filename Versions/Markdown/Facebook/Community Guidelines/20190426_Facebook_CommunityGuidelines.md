**1. Violence and Incitement** 

**I. Violence and Criminal Behavior** 

Policy Rationale 

We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. 

While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by 

threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that 

incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and 

work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm 

or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in 

order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat 

to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also 

consider additional information like a person&aposs public visibility and vulnerability. 

Do not post: 

Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any 

target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: 

Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or 

Calls for high-severity violence (unless the target is an organization or 

individual covered in the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy) 

Including content where no target is specified but a symbol represents the 

target and/or includes a visual of an armament to represent violence; or 

Statements advocating for high-severity violence (unless the target is an 

organization or individual covered in the Dangerous Individuals and 

Organizations policy); or 

Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence 

(unless the target is an organization or individual covered in the Dangerous 

Individuals and Organizations policy) 

Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, 

minor public figures, vulnerable persons, or vulnerable groups where threat is 

defined as any of the following: 

Statements of intent to commit violence; or 

Statements advocating violence (unless the target is an adult public figure 

convicted or accused of certain crimes or is a member of a dangerous 

organization); or 

Calls for mid-severity violence (unless the target is a member of a dangerous 

organization) including content where no target is specified but a symbol 

represents the target; or 

Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence (unless the target is 

an adult public figure convicted or accused of certain crimes or is a member of 

a dangerous organization); or 

Other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public figures, vulnerable 

persons, or vulnerable groups and any credible: 

Statements of intent to commit violence; or 

Calls for action of violence; or 

Statements advocating for violence; or 

Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence (unless the 

target is convicted of certain crimes or is a member of a dangerous 

organization) 

Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards 

private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is 

defined as any of the following:

a designated and recognizable at-risk group 

Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously 

injure or kill people, through: 

Language explicitly stating that goal, or 

Photos or videos that show or simulates the end result (serious injury or 

death) as part of the instruction 

Unless the aforementioned content is shared as part of recreational self 

defense, for military training purposes, commercial video games, or news 

coverage (posted by Page or with news logo) 

Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives: 

Unless there is clear context that the content is for a non-violent purpose (for 

example part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational 

purpose, fireworks, or specifically for fishing) 

**2. Dangerous Individuals and Organizations** 

**I. Violence and Criminal Behavior** 

 

Policy Rationale 

 

In an effort to prevent and disrupt real-world harm, we do not allow any organizations 

or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence, from having 

a presence on Facebook. This includes organizations or individuals involved n the 

following: 

 

Terrorist activity 

Organized hate 

Mass or serial murder 

Human trafficking 

Organized violence or criminal activity 

We also remove content that expresses support or praise for groups, leaders, or 

individuals involved in these activities.

**4. Coordinating Harm****1****2** 

**I. Violence and Criminal Behavior** 

 

Policy Rationale 

 

1 Note added by the Platform Governance Archives: From April 2018 to 30 

November 2019, sections 3 (“Promoting and Publicizing Crime”) and 4 

(“Coordinating Harm”) appeared to exist separately. However, on 30 November 

2019, Facebook merged them (see Facebook original note below). Facebook’s 

records left no trace of what exactly these two sections contained between April 

2018 and 30 November 2019. The Platform Governance Archives decided to use the 

November 2019 text retro-actively, that is, as if it was the text from April 2018 to 30 

November 2019. This is because we understand that having some record of these 

sections was better than having none, even if inaccurate. Readers should remember 

that this is only an approximation of these sections original text between April 2018 

and 30 November 2019 and, as such, should not be understood as the actual policy 

that was in place in that time period. 

 

2 Note from Facebook’s records, 30 November 2019: “Previously, our Community 

Standards included separate sections for Coordinating Harm and Promoting and 

Publicizing Crime. The sections overlapped, which created confusion for our content 

reviewers. As a result, we decided to merge the two sections and more clearly 

delineate the type of harm that we aim to prevent and disrupt - harm against people, 

animals, and property, as well as voter and census interference”. 

In an effort to prevent and disrupt offline harm and copycat behavior, we prohibit 

people from facilitating, organizing, promoting, or admitting to certain criminal or 

harmful activities targeted at people, businesses, property or animals. We allow 

people to debate and advocate for the legality of criminal and harmful activities, as 

well as draw attention to harmful or criminal activity that they may witness or 

experience as long as they do not advocate for or coordinate harm. 

Do not post content that falls into the following categories: 

 

Harm against people 

Statements of intent, calls to action, or advocating for harm against people that 

depicts, admits to, or promotes the following acts committed by you or your 

associates: 

Acts of physical harm against humans, including acts of domestic violence, 

except when shared in a context of redemption or defense of self or another 

person 

Swatting 

Encouraging participation in a high risk viral challenge 

 

Harm against animals 

Statements of intent, calls to action, or advocating for harm against animals that 

depicts, admits to, or promotes: 

Acts of physical harm against animals committed by you or your associates 

except in cases of hunting, fishing, religious sacrifice, food preparation or 

processing, pest or vermin, self-defense or redemption 

Staged animal vs. animal fights, including acts committed by a third party 

Harm against property 

Statements of intent, calls to action, or advocating for harm against property that 

depicts, admits to, or promotes the following acts committed by you or your 

associates:

systems, seek ransoms, or gain unauthorized access to data systems 

Theft when committed by you or your associates, as well as positive 

statements about theft when committed by a third party 

 

Voter Suppression 

Voter suppression, defined as: 

Misrepresentation of the dates, locations, and times, and methods for voting 

or voter registration 

Misrepresentation of who can vote, qualifications for voting, whether a vote 

will be counted, and what information and/or materials must be provided in 

order to vote. 

Other misrepresentations related to voting in an official election may be 

subject to false news standards, as referenced in section 18

**6. Suicide and Self-Injury** 

**II. Safety** 

Policy Rationale 

In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that 

encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time 

depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-

injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-

mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can 

share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from 

one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. 

We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in 

distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies 

and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not 

remove live videos of self-injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and 

authorities to provide help or resources. 

 

In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or 

survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. 

Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we 

provide. 

Do not post: 

 

Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for 

Suicide 

Self-injury 

Eating disorders 

 

Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery 

Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post 

content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide

a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: 

 

Photos or videos depicting a person&aposs death by suicide that are determined to 

be newsworthy 

Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted 

suicide in a medical setting 

 

For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware 

the content may be upsetting to some:

 **9.Bullying and Harassment** 

**II. Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, 

from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending 

threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate 

this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on 

Facebook. 

We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to 

allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are 

featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we 

remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is 

directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes 

further: we remove content that&aposs meant to degrade or shame, including, for 

example, claims about someone&aposs sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and 

harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our 

policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. 

Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is 

clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying 

and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us 

understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting 

such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on 

Facebook to help protect against it. 

We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and 

educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers 

step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations 

about bullying. 

Do not: 

Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person&aposs clear desire and action to 

prevent that contact 

Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation 

Target anyone maliciously by: 

Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault, sexual

**12. Hate Speech** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of 

intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. 

We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected 

characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual 

orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We 

also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or 

dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. 

We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. 

Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the 

purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms 

that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an 

empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic 

break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in 

a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In 

all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their 

intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is 

unclear, we may remove the content. 

We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we 

believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary 

using their authentic identity. 

Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to 

hate speech. 

Do not post: 

**Tier 1** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-

listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those 

described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is 

defined as 

Any violent speech or support in written or visual form 

 

Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: 

 

Insects 

Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically 

inferior 

Filth, bacteria, disease and feces 

Sexual predator 

Subhumanity 

Violent and sexual criminals 

Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or 

saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] 

are ‘criminals’”) 

 

Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person 

is depicted in an image 

Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form 

**Tier 2** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-

listed characteristics, where attack is defined as 

Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person&aposs or a group&aposs physical, 

mental, or moral deficiency 

Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” 

“hideous,” “ugly”) 

Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” 

“stupid,” “idiot”) 

Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”)

to)

policies and arguments for restricting those policies. 

**Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs**, where slurs are 

defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed 

characteristics. 

 

**13. Violent and Graphic Content** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

 

We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of 

others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We 

allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about 

issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human 

rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different 

sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a 

warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to 

people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or 

violent nature before they click to see it. 

Do not post: 

 

Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or 

captions by the poster that contain 

 

Enjoyment of suffering 

Enjoyment of humiliation

**15. Sexual Solicitation** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

 

Policy Rationale 

As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), 

people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and 

exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. 

We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates 

sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that 

may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may 

be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to 

connect with their friends and the broader community. 

Do not post: 

Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities including but not 

limited to: 

 

Filmed sexual activities 

Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances

but not limited to the following:

with at least one of the following elements, none of which violate our Community 

Standards on their own:

Sexualized slang 

Using sexual hints such as mentioning sexual roles, sex positions, fetish 

scenarios, sexual preference/sexual partner preference, state of arousal, act 

of sexual intercourse or activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring),

buttocks, state of hygiene of genitalia or buttocks 

 

An offer or ask for other adult activities such as:

mentioning of: 

 

A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection)

**17. Spam** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

 

Policy Rationale 

We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, 

fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people&aposs ability to share and 

connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to 

collect likes, followers, or shares.

Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or 

private individual 

Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people

before viewing 

 

Encourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses

first change to this section happens occurred in July 2019. However, merely 

subtracting the new content added in July 2019 leaves this excerpt truncated. 

Therefore, the expression “makes fun of” was added by us as attempt to reconstruct 

what was the likely meaning of the text before July 2019. 

Using another person’s login credentials or personally identifiable 

information

**19. False news** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy rationale 

 

Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take 

seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want 

to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is 

also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we 

don&apost remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its 

distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to 

reduce the spread of false news here. 

 

We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false 

news in a number of different ways, namely by 

 

Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that 

propagate misinformation 

Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a 

machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false 

Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party 

fact-checkers 

Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by 

informing them with more context and promoting news literacy 

Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this 

challenging issue 

 

 

**20. Memorialization** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy Rationale

,When someone passes away, friends and family can request 

that we memorialize the account by adding "Remembering" above the name on the 

person&aposs profile. This makes it clear that the account is now a memorial site and 

protects against attempted logins and fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, 

or change anything about the profile or the account because we want to respect the 

choices someone made while still alive. We have also made it possible for people to 

identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. People can 

let us know in advance if they want their account permanently deleted when they die. 

We may delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed 

would have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it. 

Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and 

process.
