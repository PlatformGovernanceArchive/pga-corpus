**Content Code of Conduct**

**Date of Last Revision: May 24, 2007**

Facebook is a social utility that connects people with friends and others who work, study and live around them. People

use Facebook to keep up with friends, to share links, to share photos and videos of themselves and their friends, and

to learn more about the people they meet. We want Facebook to be a place where people respect the rights and

feelings of others, including third party intellectual property rights. Therefore, we have established certain rules for

using Facebook and for posting messages, photos, video and other content ("Content") on Facebook, which rules are

set forth in our Terms of Use and in this User Code of Conduct. WHEN YOU USE FACEBOOK, YOU ARE AGREEING TO

ABIDE BY THE USER CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE OTHER RULES SET FORTH IN OUR TERMS OF USE. FAILURE TO ADHERE

TO THIS CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE TERMS OF USE MAY RESULT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IN TERMINATION OF YOUR

ACCOUNT AND THE DELETION OF CONTENT THAT YOU HAVE POSTED ON FACEBOOK, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE, AS

DETERMINED BY FACEBOOK IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. Please refer to our Terms of Use for more information about the

rules applicable to your use of Facebook and the other rights and remedies of Facebook.

**Third-Party Content**

Facebook allows you to upload and share user generated Content with your friends, such as photographs and videos

you upload from your camera, webcam or mobile phone. This means that you may post and share original photographs

and video that are of a personal nature that: (i) are of you or your friends, (ii) are taken by you or your friends, or (iii)

are original art or animation created by you or your friends. It is not intended as a place for you to post third-party

copyrighted content, such as the latest episode of a popular TV show or your favorite music video. In addition, we

expect our users to use good judgment and respect the copyrights and other intellectual property rights of others.

Therefore, in using Facebook, you may not:

upload or share any photographs, videos or other Content other than original works that are created by you

or another user

third party

**Inappropriate Content**

not belong in a community like Facebook. Therefore, you may not post or share Content that:

makes threats of any kind or that intimidates, harasses, or bullies anyone

is derogatory, demeaning, malicious, defamatory, abusive, offensive or hateful
